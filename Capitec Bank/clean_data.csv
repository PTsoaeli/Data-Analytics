2023/09/29 10:09,Mahlatse K,Refund Request...Worse Service Ever,"I've neve experienced such disgusting service ever.

So on the 31st of August 2023 I made a booking on bookings.com and immediately cancelled it for personal reasons, however the funds were deducted from my account but never reversed into my account liased with capitec from the day of the reversed payment and I've need promised refund to fate no refund was issued so I'm writing to hello peter to assist me in getting my refund as I need to use that money urgently, here are the list of *********** agents I dealt with:
-Nompumelelo Mkhwa****, very *********** lady who just misled me with falls information juts to get me off the line. She confirmed if I dnt get refund by Friday the 22nd September 2023 i should send an email to ***********, I followed all instructions and got no response, did a follow up email on Tuesday the 26th still did not get any response I then decided to call in spoke to Mikhail who adv his escalating the matter by Friday 29 September 2023 the money should reflect I won't need to call back again but here I am calling again and given run arounds.
- Amanda Msomi, twice as useless she ddnt even bother to hear me out she just transferred the call without advising
- Gugu Ngubeni advice she can see all the records but she needs to escalate the matter...adviced I'm waiting for anymore escalations I'm holding on the line until I get my funds back into my account she then told me about processes which I've been following since the 31st of August 2023. I then requested to speak to her Supervisor who Tshepo Lekgala this 1 right here thinks his a smooth talker  busy telling me about the same processes that Gugu told me about telling me to wait 7 days they need to dispute with the merchant and truth is I waited all the turn atounds time.privided I can't wait anymore. Can you please help me get my money reversed back into my account because dealing with Capitec directly is draining more.than anything this Tshepo boy is the rudest of them.ll I wish call cam be listened to and again I need a refund of all the airtime I spend close to R350 of airtime and still matter not resolved.",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Mahlatse K can view this message.",2023-09-29 10:32:52
2023/09/29 09:11,Caleb W,Set off without my consent,"I am totally disappointed with the service i received from Capitec. I received a msg saying that one of my accounts was in a negative balance and they have app**** a set off- meaning they have transferred money from my account with a positive balance to the one with a negative balance without my permission or even letting me know that this is it. Their terms and conditions do not even have a clause regarding ""set off"" . I am totally out of pocket now. I was not even aware that my account was in negative as on the app, it just showed a balance of R 0. 00. Yet over R 2000 was app**** as a set off. Surely they are not allowed to do this without my consent. I will be taking this up further if my money is not transferred back into my account asap.",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Caleb W can view this message.",2023-09-29 10:32:23

2023/09/28 22:36,Katleho K,Capitec bank,"On the 22 of August 2023 I created a bank account at Capitec Naledi Mall branch in vosloorus - immediately after creating the account, I tried to deposit cash (R11,000) into the account through their ATM machine outside the branch. After that, I waited for about a minute while their ATM was processing the transaction/deposit, soon after that their ATM gave me a 'deposit error' message and it gave back the card but not the cash I deposited. I immediately went back to the branch and lodged a complaint and they said it might take 24hrs - 48hrs or 14 days at most to resolve my case but nothing seems to be happening. I contact them every day and even go to their branch all they say is that they're still investigating (but via text they say my requested service was unsuccessful, and therefore the case has been closed). What does that even mean? Should I forget about my money? I asked them to escalate this matter and even check their cameras on that day but nothing is happening. I really hate this bank it has caused me a lot of stress.",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Katleho K can view this message.",2023-09-29 10:20:04

2023/09/28 21:12,Duduetsang B,Disgusting service,Capitec call centre agents service sucks!!!! My cellphone banking suddenly stopped working and when people try and send me money they receive an error message saying I've changed my number and that my number is not verified. I've been using the same number for years and it's strange that it suddenly needs to be verified when I verified it years ago. I called the call centre for assistance and I spoke to an agent that told me that she doesn't know why my number is not working and why it reflects as unverified. She works for Capitec but she can't explain what happened. It's 9pm and she told me to go to the bank to get assistance. I asked her to transfer me to someone that can explain to me what is going on and hopefully assist and she hung up on me. Is this how you train your employees? You don't teach them the basics of customer service and they know nothing about your systems. Why must I go to a branch to find out what's going on with my account when there's a call centre filled with people who should be capable of assisting me? Can someone urgently contact me and assist!???,1,1,"Good day DuduetsangThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/28 21:00,Busisiwe M,Very angry and frustrated,"Good day I am Busisiwe Mapete

I the 24th of September early hours of the morning there was a *****ulent transaction that happened in my account. So I called capitec four times to report the case but I managed to get hold of the consultant. Explained everything that an amount of R1103. 32 is missing on my account I didn't not do it or approve it.

She then said she will log a case to a relevant department and close my card because ****mers only use last 4 digits of your card number. She said I will get my money withing 7 to 14 Working days they have a lot of cases that similar to mine. And she further more said I will have to go to the bank and make new card but will use same account number


I went to the bank at Souther wood Square in EAST London the consultant that was helping me said my case /investigation is closed because it shows from their side I approved it on the App, I then told her is did not this nonsense happened early hours of the morning and I was asleep I only saw it pass 11:00am. No communication was made with me that is what ****es me off and my money is not paid back, how can I case be closed without my money being pad and me as a client being informed. Meaning that if I did not go to the back to ask the progress and do new card I was never going to find out 😭😭😭😭


I ended up closing my account because of frustration, anger and fear of this kind of case might occur again and capitec does not have control over his system.

Please see below email I wrote to them and there is no response yet

"" 
Incedent number#‪**********24‬

My name is Busisiwe Mapete ID number ‪**********9****3‬, I am writing this email with an heavy heart😭😡. The time is 20:32p..

On the 24th of September early hours of the morning there was a *****ulent transaction that happened in my account. I saw it past 11:00am while I was on the capitec app, an amount of R1103. 12 was deducted in my account and I do not know this transaction or I did not approve or do it. 

I called capitec bank 4 times, I got cutted on the phone and the other agent I spoke to said she can't assist me her system is down, I called again and managed to talk to one of your consultants, I explained everything to her and she said she will log a case to a relevant department that will do the investigations and close my card number because ****mers are using last 4 numbers of your bank card even if your card is with you, She then said, I will have to go to the bank to do a new card. She then further more said I will get communication in regards to my case and also check progress on WhatsApp number that she messaged me and my money will be paid back within 7 to 14 Working days. 

On the 26th of September I went to the bank to check the progress of my case and also do a new card since the old card was closed. I went to capitec that is based at Southernwood Square, in East London the lady that I spoke to said my case Is closed no more further investigation will be Done on my case, and I was so surprised and hurt because there was no communication that was sent to me and I don't understand why they are saying investigation is closed but my money is not paid back. The consultant said this transaction was approved on the Capitec App of which I did not approved any online purchase as I was asleep the time it occurred. 

The way I was so angry and frustrated at the bank I was not impressed with your services and no communication was made with me whereas am the one who is suffering and that is my rent money. I ended up closing the account because am scared of ever using capitec bank again because of such cases, I was then told at the bank to pay card fee so that account can be closed, I refused to do that they called the main office and we ended up closing it with no fee paid. 


Please assist and help me out I need my money, find attached recording of the call I made with you guys on the 24th and screenshot of the *****ulent transaction 😭😭😭😭

I WANT MY MONEY. HOW DO YOU CLOSE AN INVESTIGATION / CASE WITHOUT INFORMING A CLIENT, SO I WAS SUPPOSE TO GO TO THE BANK TO RE- DO ANOTHER CARD I ORDER FOR ME TO GET SUCH DISTURBING FEEDBACK😭😭😭???

If I need to make payments to service providers in excess of R3500 the app requires a selfie to be taken before the payment can be processed. Needless to say it DOES NOT WORK. The staff at my local branch are unable to help me. ""Ma'am it's best if you rather visit our branch to make these payments"" This is the only answer I get. Every time. HOW is this possible? What is the point of having a banking app if you need to visit a physical branch to make a payment? Are we moving back to the Stone Age of banking or is there a more sinister OP?
The AI on Facebook is unable to help, the Question doesn't fit into any of it's categories. The contact numbers on the Capitec Bank web page gives a ""This number does not exist"" message. What do I do? Withdraw all my money and keep it under the couch? I have never been more frustrated. What has changed at Capitec Bank?

2023/09/27 14:02,Abdul P,CAPITEC MESS UP AND DOES NOT WANT TO FIX THEIR MESS - LEFT WITHOUT SERVICE YET MONEY TAKEN,"WHAT PATHETIC SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Capitec was down yesterday (26.09.2023) and yet no communication was sent out to their customers. I am one of their customers and am having an appalling experience trying to fix the mess they caused, but nobody wants to help and take accountability. 

We are left with money that ran off our account and showing uncleared on our bank statement, yet the funds are out of our account. The service provider - MWEB/Vumatel is saying ""Sorry, we did not get the payment"". 

This, after holding for over 30 minutes on the line to MWEB, the agent Majdie advised to speak to their accounts department, but he cannot see the payment and can retry to do it again. REALLY???!!! And have more money deducted from our account? No thanks

I then call Capitec, and the agent Miekaeel said that the funds were deducted and he can see it is unprocessed, but we must call MWEB to give 'authorisation' to release or reverse the funds. Then waited for another almost 20 minutes to speak to Val at Mweb accounts. ""Nope, she does not see the payment and cannot help"". I must call Capitec as the problem and outage was on their side. Otherwise, I must call Payfast who does the payment for Vumatel/MWEB. 

WHAT THE ****** HELL MAN!!!!!! I AM A CAPITEC CUSTOMER!!!! I AM AN MWEB CUSTOMER!!!! THIS IS DUE TO A FLIPPEN ERROR BY CAPITEC (WHO BTW HAD AN OUTAGE) OR MWEB. I don't know, but now I am being disadvantaged and inconvenienced due to no fault or error on my part. 

THEY BEAUTY OF IT ALL IS THAT MY ****** FIBRE CONNECTION IS NOW SUSPENDED AND OFFLINE AND NOBODY WANTS TO HELP AND TAKE OWNERSHIP OR ACCOUNTABILITY....!!!!!!!!

I am not a payfast customer, but then called PayFast as per instruction from Val at MWEB. I the customer must spend hours holding on the line to everyone, waste my time and money making calls (and time is money), Just for Payfast to tell me ""No, MWEB is the Merchant"" Capitec paid them, they must give instruction and authorisation for the reversal of the funds. 

Benassi at Payfast put me on a long hold and said to call MWEB again when he returned onto the call. He said the bank released the funds.

2023/09/26 12:03,Elriek S,******* TRANSACTIONS/APP ERROR,"Good day. 

Allow me to make myself perfectly clear in the following review: 

CAPITEC NEEDS TO SERIOUSLY WORK ON HOW THEY HANDLE THEIR CLIENTS...as I am very much considering closing ALL of my accounts and moving to another bank.

1. About 2 till 3 months ago, (it can be longer), my  father saw that there is transactions going off from his account. He immediatly went to the branch and reported the problem. He also got a new card and everything.

The people at our branch in UPINGTON KALAHARI MALL were extremely helpful and very friendly to help us, so please note I do not have anything negative towards them - my BIG PROBLEM is with CAPITEC BANK. 

The branch has investigated and they told us that the money that was deducted from my father's accont was a physical card transaction....somewhere overseas. My  father has NEVER IN HIS LIFE been overseas ....so how can it be possible for him to be the one doing the transaction?

From my knowledge, CAPITEC BANK informed my father that they are going to investigate further and get evidence that someone did the transactions, as there were multiple transactions, in order for CAPITEC to get OUR MONEY back to us.

And to my surprise, CAPITEC have the audacity to send my father an email or sms that says my father gave consent with a ""ONE TIME PIN"" for the transactions the be approved...on what grounds does CAPITEC have any right do say that? Where is their prove? The amount that was deducted in total was almost a STAGGERING R18 000!!!!!!!

We have reported CAPITEC to the OMBUDSMAN for banks and they are still investigating the matter, but let make myself perfectly clear: CAPITEC must find the evidence that is needed so we can get our money back. Like I have mentioned above, on what grounds does CAPITEC have the right to say that my father gave consent with a ONE TIME PIN? Everyone knows that if there is a notification for a transaction that you are NOT AWARE of, you do not approve it. My father did NOT receive nor entered ANY ONE TIME PINS. He just noticed that there were money deducted from his account. 

I will personally make it my mission in life to REPEATEDLY report CAPITEC BANK on Hello Peter until we can see a effort from their side until we see our money. The fault was not ours, but CAPITEC's lack of tracing where the actual transaction was made. 

2. Also, yet again, for the millionth time, the CAPITEC app is again, not working. This seriously needs to be addressed. I have reported this many times, and it gets fixed but time and time again, there is always something that goes wrong with the app and to be honest, I as a vauled and trusted customer of CAPITEC bank am getting sick of this nonsense!!

SIDE NOTE: 
I am writing this review on my Hello Peter account, but the person who you can contact regarding this is my father. I will give his information below:

Mr. Hendrik Swanepoel
Cellphone: **********

To close off: We are not going to leave this. CAPITEC seriously needs to addres this ASAP. We will inforce getting legal help if we must, be we will refrain from doing that until we have given CAPITEC every chance they have to sort this out.

Good day.

King regards

2023/09/24 11:16,Ruben M,Capitec's negligence with Debit orders and failing to follow agreements,"In September 2023, Capitec Decided to take the Debit orders for my Credit card and access facility on the 23rd instead of my salary date(usually the 25th) Completely wiping me of any money I had left in my account, 
the Credit card debit order went through
But the other the access facility debit order did not due to insufficient funds,
Then they took the money that was available in the access facility, leaving it at R0 and claiming the account is now paused because it is in arrears and I have missed a payment and that i have to make a transfer to unpause the account
I have never missed a payment in YEARS, now they are claiming my account is in arrears and this will count as a missed payment or late payment affecting my credit score,
Now I am facing a black mark against my credit score because of their negligence and for them not following the agreement that they will take the debit orders on my salary date which was not the case

The payment bounced back as I had no funds available to pay them on the dare they decided to deduct on. They started sending me different amounts of money that I must pay so as to cover the arrears, I went to their bank and made arrangement hat the money I owe must be divided into 2 installments, August and Sept. On the 14th of August I received an sms saying my lian payment will be debited on the 15th, I DO NOT HAVE A LOAN WITH CAPITEC. I went there again to rectify this, they said no it was an error they are referring to a credit card. On the 15th of September they deducted what was supposed to be their last installment on arrears of what I owe as per the agreement. This morning 23 September I receiving another annoying phone call saying I owe them R1. 310. 57 when I asked why this money was not deducted, they saying it's credit card insurance money. I thank God that capitec is NOT my main bank, I'll go mad. Those people are so *********** and their incompetency inconveniences us.

2023/09/22 08:16,CJH H,Capitec Business Bank  - Research before you commit!!,"I have been a client of Capitec Personal Banking for quite some time and I haven't had much issue with them so I decided to open a Capitec Business Account. BIG MISTAKE!!
Opening the account was easy but that's where it ended. 
No one tells you that the app doesn't use any form of biometrics so you basically cannot access your banking app without compromising your security and having this random username written down somewhere, You then get an OTP which is needed to login so if you don't have signal due to loadshedding or are in an area with poor signal, you have no access to your banking app. 

I received a welcome letter with my account number and after I google the branch code for Capitec banking, I provided my clients with these bank details. Wrong!! Apparently Capitec Business bank has a different branch code (doesn't show on Google) but they also don't inform you of that one either. All my payments failed. 

Now I see there are problems with receiving notifications. Either you don't receive them at all or they are delayed and come much later. How will that help if someone clones my card or accesses my account and commits *****? It will be far too late to stop anything. 

This is not a cheap account. Not only is there the monthly fee of R65 but you are also charged R5 for each and every transaction you make. At this rate, I expect far better service.

The call centre staff are not geared to business users and need a spruce up for sure.

July the money came in and I sent all relevant documents to the CCSDECEASED department. I was told it takes 11 working days to review.

I sent them what they asked for but that wasn't even good enough. They want to run up more charges before releasing the funds to me.

2023/09/21 14:19,Anna,CAPITEC VISHING ****,"HELLO PETER,
 
RE:  CAPITEC VISHING ****
 
It is with great disappointment and a lack of customer care from Capitec Bank that I am sharing with you what has happened, and this has been dragging on for too long without the outcome I hoped for.   Capitec is one of the strongest banks in SA.  I am very cautious when it comes to ****s, but I was caught off guard.   I am a 78-year-old lady and never thought this would happen to me and being treated this way!
19th of April, I have asked the manager at Capitec Grove to assist me with a transfer to my FNB account.  The only reason for this request is because I was not fami**** with the phone app.  25th of April I received a phone call from the ****mer who knew all my details saying they discovered a debit order on my account of R99 and they will stop this as this is not supposed to be there.  They asked me to put my PIN in on my phone, but to not say it or never give it out.   They gave me their FSP number et al.  The next I know; all my savings was withdrawn from my account.
I followed protocol and went to the closest branch, The Grove.  A JJ assisted me and said I need to go to the SAPS to open a case, which I did.  Next day I went back to Capitec and JJ said I needed a copy.  No one told me.  So back and forth, I got the copy.   The 27th I was at the bank again to speak to JJ and they told me he was no longer working there.  This was odd to me.   
I phoned the ***** management department and spent all my airtime holding on to speak to the “correct” person. 
I went back and wanted to speak to the manager.   She was not always there, and no one was willing to give her name to me.   Then the SAPS case was transferred to Silverton.   I received 3 SMS’ with 3 different officers stating they are investigating.   One officer stated that they are not getting any response from Capitec Grove.   I got the Ombudsman involved.   
I was told to wait till the end of May.   No response from any parties involved.  I contacted the Ombudsman again and then they said 2nd of August.   This also didn’t pay off, for if I didn’t push for feedback, I would still be waiting.  Then I received documents of 60+ pages!?   And then Capitec has the mordacity to ask me to give them feedback if the issue was resolved?
I know of many people who were also ****med through other prominent banks and with no issues, they were refunded. 
All banks have insurance for cases like these.   Why can’t Capitec accommodate me?   This is all the savings I have.   I believe that most ****s happen within the banks itself.
I need assistance, and I need to be refunded.   
Can you please help?",1,1,"Good day AnnaThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day.Kind regardsCapitec Bank",2023-09-21 14:21:50

I was paying both loans on a monthly basis as promised and agreed until i realised that I was now over indebted and should not have taken both loans.  I then signed up for debt review where these two accounts were included into in August 2018.  I was then paying same monthly on debt review.  I went off debt review and started paying my accounts myself directly again in 2019.  Capitec could not pick up these two accounts and on a few occassions my payments were repaid back into my account after which i stopped paying.  I was then approached by attorneys years later to start making payment, which I did to date.  Last year November before I received my bonus I approached these attorneys for a settlement amount in order to settle these two accounts.  Thee would not budge on letting me pay on a discounted rate that I proposed only their ridiculous rate.

I want at Capitec Bank Nelspruit Crossings to fix the mess that they’ve caused… I went to Capitec to open an account so I can put in some money whenever but, this lady by the name of Fundisile went through my profile and, process everything without my approval as if I’m changing accounts and, I’m not… at this point I can’t even trust Capitec cause according to my understanding no one is supposed to view clients account without them or process/approve anything without the client being present…. This is ***** and i won’t take it… now I’m being called to confirm whether I’m changing banks or not…

2023/09/21 08:01,Mosa,Horrible Bank.,"This is a useless bank that I gave a chance because I thought that they were great. Internet banking very inconvenient, they give you a token that if you use app log in then they deactivate the token and it will never work again and they do not even inform their customers of this. Now if I want to use the token again I must go to them and buy a new token. Where is convenience? The whole reason for internet banking is convenience but with Capitec you will get the worst experience. They want us in lines sitting at their branches as if we do not have anything better to do with our time. The simplified personal banking is not so simplified when you are their customer. Horrible experience and planning on closing my account and switching my salary back to my FNB account because they know what internet and cellphone banking is all about.

The whole of SASSA was in a huge mess I then took the new card and I tried to withdraw money and the statement read insufficient funds whereas my Old age Pension was paid in after 12 midnight and I got an SMS stating that, the consultant at the bank told me because of the SASSA mess I must try after 4pm I then put my Telkom card in my phone around 8pm and I got SMS's stating R2,000.00 was withdrawn at an FNB ATM in Grand Central in the CBD in Cape Town at 11:09am that's exactly the time my card was swallowed by a Nedbank ATM 16.8Km's away where I was still standing in front of the ATM.
This morning I sent Capitec a WhatsApp message with the following:

I had a loan agreement with CapitalBank  of 48 months from 08/06/2019 which was supposed to end on the 15/06/2023.  I was surprised to find out that one month has been skipped on the January 2020. I fail to understand why debit was not done on the 15th because money was still in the account until 19 /01/2020. I found out this year in July that one month has been added to the skipped month. the bank debited again in the august 2023 . The guy by the name of Jamie from capitecbank called me before august debit, he promised to do investigation and come back to me. instead of coming back to me he sends email that i have agreed that i will pay august debit. my worry is that he said our conversation has been recorded but he **** about our conversation. what i can say is that the bank has debited two more months from my account. i did consult with ombudsman to assist me but the bank debited my account while my case is still with ombudsman. I am getting paid through capitecbank, now i m starting to doubt the bank with my money. i want the august debit .kindly assist.",1,1,"Good day AmogelangThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

On the 19 July 2023 I noticed that an online purchase was done via my Capitec Bank credit card with an amount of R989 at 23h37, I did visit the branch 8h00am, they promised that a follow up will be done and they will get to me within 7-14 days.
On the 21 July 2023 I did receive a call that they are people from Capitec ***** department and they a trying to trace who & where was the purchase done, so I was made to get into my app and that's where they we able to get into my account and make a revolving loan without my consent telling me that all my money will be be back into my account, on the 22 July they gave me another call to check if ever my money was back, I said no, and they continue with the transactions again.
After all this someone called me from Capitec asking me why this amount of money was being used, so I did visit the branch again and they refer me to visit our police station which I did and gave them my case number. 
After all this there was no response up until I visited the branch again on the 21 &  24 August 2023 to check, they said they will get back to me but I had to pay back that money (R115000) whilst they are investigating the case.

Have complained several times on HP including over 2 years ago.,"I have been fighting with Capitec Business for over 2 years (see my previous complaints here on HelloPeter) to get my sms notifications sorted out!  I have been given every excuse under the sun and been moved between relationship bankers (several times from my request for appalling service and a couple of times by the bank without even notifying me!).

I still do not get sms notifications.  This is on top of:
Bank card often does not work and bankers take weeks to get back with any kind of response
Everyone at the bank gives different and mostly conflicting information
Complaints are ignored unless on Hellopeter
Statements are not always sent
Email notifications often have no reference or even whether money is incoming or outgoing
Clients often complain they cannot make payments to us

We have had to open a second account with Std Bank just so we can buy airtime, electricity and top up courier account with payfast as Capitec does not offer any of these.   You won't even be able to pay for a tollgate.

Two years of chasing trying to get my notifications to work on the phone which is a serious security issue not knowing when money is going out the account and a serious issue for us conducting business efficiently with knowledge of incoming payments.",1,1,"Good day Graham Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I knew it must be a mistake, so I powted it on my social media and asked who knows this person, they need to contact me. So knowing it was a mistake, I moved the money to my Capitec savings to make sure my debit orders and person payment won't tap into the money who was wrongly paid to me. 

So on Monday the 4th of September, I received a call from Capitec asking if I received an amount if R19000, so I say yes. They said the people are sitting infront of them, they got high jacked, and the money got paid to my account accidentally, will I pay it back. So I said, yes offcourse I will. So she asked if I can plewse speak to the people, so she hands the phone to the people, and I recognize the people. They bought a car from me a month before and that is why I was a beneficiary on their bank. So I tell them, I am just going into a meeting, can I call them on their new number in 2 hours so transfer the money back. And they said thank you and 2 hours went past. 

As I am about to pay the money back, I see that on my banking app, I have no money in my savings. It doesn't even exist on my app. So I rush to Capitec to find out that they stopped my savings account because I am under investigation. So I understood it and they said it will all be sorted out in 7 working days. So I left it and waited. 

Then on Friday the 8th of September, I ask on the Capitec what's app for my balance to see if they reversed the money and if I can go on with my life. Then I see, that Capitec DID NOT reverse R19000, but they reversed R24000!!! A WHOLE EXTRA R5000!! So now I am so upset, I got to the bank and I am trying to find out why they took extra money for no reason. After 2 hours of trying to figure out, they treat me like the ********. I had to go to the police after being questioned over and over again and had to explain myself 100 times. So I had to go to the police, explain everything AGAIN and get a avidavid. 

So I had to go back to Capitec and then EXPLAIN myself on a report again. Where it's actually this easy, someone in Capitec just decided to take an extra R5000, just give it back and unblock my account. But I am STILL to this day under investigation and NO ONE can give me any answers. 

I am going to fight until I get my money back and all our hard work savings in that account! Then I am moving banks, because Capitec just takes money as they please... then no one takes responsibility. I have been to Capitec to many times the past few days, and still nothing has been done. I will make EVERYONE aware.",1,1,"Good day Michaela Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/18 21:12,Lerato S,Capitec Bank is the absolute worst!!!,"My mother was ****med in June 2023.****mers reversed y mom's debit order from the previous months and went off with about R12 000 or more. Capitec today 18 September comes back to my mom and tells her there's nothing they can do besides close the account that the ****mers used to transfer money into.. Absurd.. Absolutely ridiculous because
1. Why are debit orders kept for so long on ""reversal option""
2. If they think my mother did this why would she gain as a pensioner who is looking to closing off her debts? This would set her back drastically
3..isnt there a limit of reversal debit order amounts why did the bank allow it to reach as much as 12k?

4. What must my mother do after being told there's nothing they can do?

I find this very disappointing in Capitec as they should have mitigation and precaution measures in place to avoid this. Now my mom lapsed insurances including life and funeral insurance because of this which have been avoided if Capitec restricted reversals. Not happy with this resolution at all!!! 😠😠😠😠",1,1,"Good day LeratoThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/18 15:45,DAVID A,Capitec care more about *****sters!!!!,"Dear CAPITEC,

I am writing to express my deep concern about a recent experience I had regarding *****ulent ****s and the lack of prompt action on your part. As a loyal customer of CAPITEC for over 10 years, I expected better from your institution.

I recently fell victim to a ***** **** that was immediately reported and followed by an SAP affidavit within 48 hours. However, to my dismay, the ****mer was able to resurface and deceive me once again. As a pensioner and a divorced individual, I find it disheartening that I, a vulnerable woman, have to bear the brunt of such *****ulent activities.

I have taken all the necessary steps and fulfilled my obligations in this matter, so it is deeply disappointing to realize that I might lose R6000 as a result. This incident has shaken my trust in CAPITEC, an institution I held in high regard.

I implore you to address this situation promptly and rectify the matter at hand. Failure to do so may result in me sharing my unfortunate experience with the public, cautioning them to be wary of CAPITEC and its alleged support of *****ulent activities.

I eagerly await your response and an explanation as to why I was not informed earlier about this matter.

Sincerely,
EJ Smith",1,1,"Good day David Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day.",2023-09-18 16:04:45

It’s the last time im going to use this bank for anything serious. After this payment I’ll go and use Nedbank because so many people have good things to say about the bank.

I called the customer care and was told that i need to be transferred to collections department, i was transferred and no answer. I had to call again trying all options requesting the direct number for the collwctions department. The numver is given but bo one can even say which option you should choose.

Just because an employer decided to reference the payment as salary then Capitec decided to debit my account. Despite what the agreed debit date is. This is a bank i pay every month with no defaults.

2023/09/15 00:56,Craig A,Capitec incompetence,"I would like to share an experience that has completely messed up my entire month of September. So Firstly I have been with Capitec Bank for Almost 10 years now and have always been a loyal customer not once have a had an issue that has destroyed my lifestyle like this. On Friday 1st of September I made an online payment to my Wifi Provider Mweb and my money was taken out of my savings account. The very next day the Saturday I woke up to my Wifi not working, first thing I do is to call mweb and ask them guys what's happening I have paid but my Wifi is down.They then advise me that my account is suspended due to non payment and I insist to the consultant that I have paid as the funds has left my account. After spending R100 Airtime,the consultant then advises me that I will recieve a callback from his manager during the course of the day bear in mind I am on my way to work and my wife and kids are at home with no wifi which means no tv no games no entertainment nothing. After 3hours at work my wife informs me the wifi is back on. The wifi stays on for the entire weekend. Monday morning I wake up to no wifi again I continue to call mweb and spend another R100 airtime speaking to different departments and I get told it will be investigated. This continues until Wednesday I woke up with some pain in my back and I make my way to the doctor and get booked off sick for Wednesday and Thursday. The Entire Wednesday and Thursday I am on the phone with mweb and Capitec because according to mweb they have not received the funds and according to Capitec they cannot release the funds. Thursday 7th of September day 4 of No wifi after ""paying for the wifi"" i speak to a Team Leader at Capitec after spending more than R300 airtime waiting hours on the line with *********** staff,Staff that drop the call on me because I have spoken to Capitec that much I know exactly what the verification process is that I give all my details without being asked. I requested to speak to a manager approximately 10 and it eventually happened on the Thursday. Young Lady very polite and respectful however she then informs me that ""My Money"" that was deducted out of My Capitec account is now sitting in my UNPROCESSED payments which essentially means it's with the bank but it's not on my account anymore but it was a successful payment to Mweb via Pay fast whom is the 3rd Party Payment Merchant. I am then asked to get an Authorization letter from either Mweb or Pay fast to authorize a payment from my account to the 3rd Party merchant. I call Mweb again and I have even spoke to Pay fast as mweb got tired of speaking to me another R200 airtime later. I eventually speak to Pay fast whom informs me I'm sorry sir we don't have an authorization letter to provide you, at this point I'm about to lose it because I felt like what more do I need to do to get my money back or just to have this sorted. I again call Capitec and whatsapp capitec because I just needed to try all methods with the hope of somebody understanding my situation and helping me. Whatsapp assistance is a joke because they either take forever to respond or they don't respond. I eventually get through to an agent I immediately request for a team leader because I have no faith in the front line agents at this point. I explain my situation to the Team Leader who then advised me to get some sort of letter or email from Pay fast or Mweb to authorize the payment in order for Capitec to refund me my money. I inform the manager that Pay fast doesn't have any formal document and I just get told there is nothing that can be done I can't get my money back unless this 3rd party merchant provides a authorization letter. Ridiculous if I must say so myself. I then get in touch with pay fast I speak to another team leader whom I beg for some sort of letter,the young lady drafts an email with the transaction details etc. I immediately whatsapp capitec because I don't want to spend anymore money on airtime I have already spent almost R1000. No luck with Capitec whatsapp I call and the Team leader tells me I'm sorry sir we need a Pdf format as according to them it can't be edited. I tell the lady on the line EVERYTHING can be edited and now I'm at a point where I cannot even get upset anymore.im exausted and mentally drained not even a double shift at my technical support job gave me this amount of mental frustration. I'm on the call for almost 2hours and I decided to do something different I book an Uber and make my way to my nearest branch and upon arrival I request to speak to the branch manager. I start explaining my situation and im providing all the evidence and details I accumulated during the entire week. She really tried to assist me but while I was in the branch on Thursday evening an agent from Capitec Call Centre calls me and informs me my issue needs to be escalated to the card disputes department. Also what I have been told is that when a transaction is not processed in 3days it gets refunded back to the savings account which in this case has not which is abit worrying as a loyal customer. Anyway I get informed this processed will take 5-10 business days. I then decide to pay mweb again because I need wifi I can't let entire family suffer due to the incompetence of Capitec staff. So now I am out of pocket R1000 Airtime R1700 (2 payments to mweb) and R500 data which I needed to buy to survive without wifi. Today the 15th of September I get a text and a missed call from capitec saying I need to contact them urgently. I call them and guess what the person that is dealing with this is not available and will be in contact with me. Come on guys i literally cannot buy bread or milk for my family because of this but you expect me to wait any longer. I hope hello Peter comes to my rescue because this is not fair towards a very loyal client",1,1,"Good day CraigThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Maybe Capitec forces its workers to call customers but there is not even any need to.

The whole experience from the time he called, was more like it was the customer who was bothering him & Capitec.


Next time just tell your customers to open accounts at the other banks FNB or ABSA!!!

Went to constantia Capitec to report and called the ***** line before that who gave instructions what to do. I received a call 2 weeks ago after numerous emails and phonecalls and the response is they have a backlog and still no investigation done. Today I call to follow up I get transferred to 4 different people. The 4th person transfers me back to the ***** department where I'm holding on for 15 minutes. This is how Capitec treat their clients. Most of all my account was hacked where my daily limit was R40 because this happened before, still  half of my money was drawn out of my account. This is the worst bank to deal with. They can't even transfer you to the correct department.
If you Google capitec ***** incidents, they clearly state if you reported it within 3 days your money will be returned within 7 days if you a victim of *****.

I had taken out a funeral cover for my family at capitec in 2022. My brother passed away on the 30/08/2023. I submitted my claim on Sarurday the 02/09/2023 at Randfontien Tambotie mall capitec, some documents where outstanding the police report . The agent  by the name Omphemetse at  capitec advised me that she has submitted my claim they will prosess the claim so long and pay the half of the claim as its an accidental death, than when i submit the police report the remaining claim will be paid. Monday the 04/09/2023 I went to the police station to get the police report the warrant offices who is handling the case informed me that the report takes a long time. 


The funeral was Tuesday the 05/09/2023. On Thursday the 07/09/2023 I went back to capitec to inform them that I was unable to get the police report the agent who has been assisting (Omphemetse) me said she had been trying to get hold of me, she wanted to give me a form from Capitec their own Police Report Form. I was angry that they did not give it to me in the beginning non the less I went to the police station to get it completed by the warrant officer. I submitted it immediately the same day. 
 Friday the 08/09/2023 I sent an email to make enquiry about the claim. That is the response I received from Capitec. 
( below)

- Post Mortem

Saturday the 09/09/2023 I called capitec spoke to Malesa Ndou I  informed her that even the warrent office has not received the post mortem herself how do they expect me to get it. 

She promised to ask the funeral claims department to call me until  today I have not received a call back. 
Today 12/09/2023  again I went to police station to check if the warrent office  has received the post mortem report Its still not available. 

I hade to borrow money to bury my brother as if I had not been paying for a funeral cover to prepare me from having to deal with money problem while am going through a sad time, that is axactly what capitec has done to me. 

Still on the 12/092023 As I type this I have not received anything from Capitec, am still owing people.

2023/09/10 12:27,Elizabeth,"CAPITEC BUSINESS BANK ***** department is nonexistent, nor in lodging a complaint, nor via telephone.","I'm beyond furious with CAPITEC BUSINESS BANK. About 3 weeks 6 SMS were sent where a certain *SS Microsoft@ showed withdrawals of R1each.  I immediately transferred the money in my business account to my personal account. I lodged a secure complaint on the Capitec Banking app.  4 days later I was informed via message on the online app that no money was deducted. End. I felt like Capitec was telling me no money was deducted, what are you complaining about.  I complained on social media, just to find there are more of Capitec clients with the same complaint.  Today the same thing happened. I immediately transferred AGAIN the money. I TRIED to phone Capitec. Take note - TRIED. I went through 4 agents, explaining the situation, just to be transferred to another agent.  The fifth transferred call I was politely informed of the business hours.  End of call.

I'm sorry to say, but Capitec is the worst bank for business. I am very concerned about the fact that the number that appears on the sms, is the legit Capitec number that appears on all the transactions, although Capitec denied any transactions made. And yes, the R6 was not transferred. The second concern I have is the fact that after each R1 transaction, the precise balance on my account has shown on the sms.  How is this possible? I'm sorry to say, I do not trust Capitec Bank with my money and also their reluctance to solve my complaint.",1,1,"Good day Elizabeth Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/09 18:34,Kwenzeka M,Bunch of money mafias!,"I don’t even know where to start with this bank. I have a credit facility with them and they have auto arranged for my limit to be decreased because they say I have app**** for credit at the time which I did not. This happened on the 24th of August 2023. Just clear everything - My account was up to date and I also had paid more money into the account so that I can have funds reserved for emergencies. After they debited me for my monthly instalment I transferred extra funds and I had a positive balance of R2000 in the account. 

The problem started when I couldn’t access the facility account - Upon querying this with the customer care agent I was told there is a technical problem with the facility and it will be resolved soon. I was given a reference **********70 by the lady consultant and she told me all their calls or queries have a reference. 

The following day I checked my emails and found that my limit was decreased because they say I have app**** for credit hence they have decided to decrease my limit. I was flying out and didn’t have time to call. When I had time to call - all the agents checked and found that my account was in good standing and they further started to say my facility might have been decreased as a result of my other accounts with other service providers. I was transferred from pillar to post and when I asked for a reference from the collections agent he told me they don’t have references. Contrary to what the lady that gave me the reference the previous day said. Just shows how *********** they are! How do you just decide to decrease the limit and say it’s because of other accounts I have with others!? Besides even if that’s the case - I had an arrangement in place for my account in arrears. On top of this all along I have been prioritising Capitec facility account amongst all the accounts I have but they decided to just thank me with a plate full of brownies! 

Well it has worked! I am actually going to prioritise it even more to settle this account as soon as possible and close all the accounts I have with them. I have left all the accounts on zero and everytime I make a payment to that facility I will request for a decrease until it’s paid up. Yes I’m just a drop in the ocean because you have millions of clients but surely it make a difference in my life as I am also going to get my wife to close her accounts as well - All my family in fact! 

Just a few days ago my child was so sick that I had no plan assist because the only little funds I had kept in the facility were taken by force since I owe them that facility account number ********** - If I knew I would have kept the funds in my other bank. 

Thank you for waking me up! You definitely deserve a proper word of mouth with everyone I come across - I will tell them how good you are to take money for the incorrect reasons. 

Losing about 10 clients won’t make any difference to you but over time if 10 clients are lost every six months it will make a difference to gain more clients to your competitors.

My token is no longer working so all I needed was for it to be replaced. I prefer the token to the app because of the amount of ***** cases that app users have reported. I have been using the token for years without any problem.
They had no tokens at the branch, instead of the consultant phoning to find out where and when she can get tokens she made me sound illiterate saying all clients now prefer the app and they are advising their clients to change to the app.
I am well aware about the app but I prefer the token, what is so confusing about that??????
If tokens have been done away with why is there no clear communication with your clients?
Some of your staff really lack common courtesy and respect for other individuals.

Well story in short, yes they accept to replace my card second time and I have to pay for it.which is not my fault (and for me it's a Big NO. NO. I have nothing to do with ATMs or card chip of capitec.

How do you expect people to trust a bank that is not able to prevent theft from accounts then denies that it is possible instead of trying to find the solution?????

A large amount of money was ****** from us. Someone seemed to have hacked our account and stole R11 000 from us. We phoned yesterday and was told that if the money is availble in the other account we could maybe get it back after 60 days. 
When I phoned again today I was told that the insident was never logged and it is impossible for someone to ***** the money that way.

2023/09/08 07:50,Cornelia,Capitec bank,"Capitec has grown into a huge financial institution over the past few years.
I have a savings account and it is a great back up account.
However, when it comes to paying big sums of money to a ****mer, unfortunately Capitec can't compete with banks like Absa; FNB.
I can only blame myself for being ****med out of R105000.00, but when you are so desperate, you don't think rationale.
Capitec has no safety measures in place (like Absa) to verify the IPP addresses when you make an immediate payment, and especially if it is large amounts of money. and that large amounts go out on the same day.
I have been ****med and lost my only saving I had, there is nothing left.

Do not respond to anybody impersonating a FB friend to make investments...
It looks so legist and the hacked account of my FB friend reassured me all the time that it is 100% safe.

2023/09/07 15:40,June,Refusing to give my son's bit of money to him.,"I would like to make a complaint concerning Capitec Bank in Cresta Mall.
My son has an account with them and for 4 months has being receiving 1,600 rand per month from a friend in Bratislava Slovakia. The gentleman's name is Mr. Vladimir Dzuricek. It is a gift given.
This month, the bank refused to give him his bit of money saying that he must fill in an Indemnity form with his details and that of the sender's details. The gentleman sending the money has said he is not prepared to give out his personal details as it is an invasion of his privacy.
A Capitec gentleman told my son that they will not give him his money now, they are keeping it, and went as far as blocking any future payment gifts from this overseas gentleman.
Firstly, this bit of money does not belong to the bank concerned, they have no right to "" *****"" my son's gift and also they had no authority to just block the bank account from being able to receive any money from overseas. He was told to go to Western Union but excuse me, WHY ARE YOU KEEPING THE SENT MONEY? IT DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU!!!!!!!
Please be very careful of Capitec. And yes, we want my son's money!!!

2023/09/06 18:33,TSHEPO,Worst bank EVER!!!,Capitec has by far become the worst bank to deal with. The were very unhelpful with my wife's money was lost due to ***** and just didn't give a damn. Reported the incident and nothing came of it. Their app is faulty every now and then and especially when you need it most. They now have blocked my account even after the sender confirmed numerous times with his bank that funds are authorized. They are quick to block the account and very slow and unbothered to even assist in resolving the matter. I've been left stranded with no money and all my urgent expenses are on stand still. I'm extremely unhappy!!!,1,1,"Good day Tshepo Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/06 14:03,Lesley M,Worst bank ever,I took out a loan with Capitec bank in June and what a mistake that was. They a setting up debit order dates that are before my day which adds interest and will affect my ITC profile as I will be seen as a late payer. I don't understand this as my salary gets paid into Capitec and never once have I gotten paid on the 21st of the month. Then when I emailed customer service they want me to send documents to prove my pay date which is an inconvenience. Number 1 I bank with you so you should see a trend as to when my salary gets paid in. No 2 my payslip will not have my pay date and no 3 getting a letter from my work with a letter head just to show my date is something I don't have time to do. All I asked was to check when my salary gets deposited and adjust the date accordingly you cannot be making your own dates and then charge my interest. If this isn't dealt with I will be taking it further,1,1,"Good day Lesley Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/06 11:35,Traci A,Tired of the lack of security with capitec,"Two years ago I had an issue with companies that load debichecks to my account without my approval.
I contacted my bank and they managed to sort it out after weeks of struggle.
Now I'm facing the same issue.
A company called Makanda Finance Hass loaded a debit check to my account twice and an amount of R600 and some went off last month, this month I see they landed again.
I had a contract with them which I settled many years ago and I asked capitec to assist me with getting this money back and canceling the Debi and they refuse or say they can't, however It was done two years ago.
Also I had a situation where Netflix deducted early and I called in spoke to consultant and he reversed the amount 2 months ago, same month same thing happened called again they said they can't do it.
Went into the bank and they said there is no history of a reversal as this is a subscription.
I then showed them the text notification showing it went off and came back but for some reason things get removed from there systems making the client look crazy.

I have been with capitec for over 15 years however this is it now. I am a single parent I do not earn much and if my bank can't help me then why am I staying.
I need assistance with getting this Debi check off my account and that money returned because I know it can be done.

I was recently involved in a car hi jacking and kidnapping case and guns pointing at me to jump on my car and me taken to a location I have never been before was a  terrible experience on it own. But having all my money transfered and my cards been swiped in various stores and ATMs was part off the ordeal I experience that night. I was held captives and abused only for my funds in my bank account. Money I worked hard for and money I was saving to free my car that I recently purchased. Reporting the matter opening a case of ***** and theft with the police station was a process I completed. However going into the capetic branch for assistance with reporting the ***** and theft matter was a waste of my time and energy. The only assistant I received from them was making a new card so they can secure Me as a client still. Worse bank ever. My monthly salary goes Into this account. The guy that assisted me was the branch was useless because he made me feel like it's my fault for been in this situation. He told me it's not a ***** or theft case. If he was held hostage like I was against your will having your life treathen with a gun and the made sure that I was only let go if I gave them my details. Would he have still not gave he's banking details and passwords. I have three year old old and a family to live for. If I had died that night my child with have grown up without a father. Calling the ***** like was a mission impossible but eventually I logged my call and got a reference number. But till date I was not contacted by the investigation officer or the bank regarding the case. I se t through all documentation they required and still the have not called or gave me any update. I am sure that is a matter that requires someone attention. I lost around 26 000 thousand that night. And to know that the capitec bank feels no remorse or is taking no action is disappointing. Atms and stores don't keep camera footage for long.

2023/09/05 09:30,Anelisa Z,Urgent Complaint: Unresolved Issues with Credit Card and Loan Account,"Dear Capitec Bank Complaints Department,

I hope this message finds you. My name is Anelisa Zide, and I am writing to express my extreme frustration and dissatisfaction with the recent experiences I have had with Capitec Bank regarding my credit card and loan accounts.

 I have a credit card and loan account with Capitec Bank, both of which are currently in arrears. I am deeply disappointed with the level of service and mismanagement of my accounts, and I believe it is necessary to bring these issues to your attention.

On August 25th, 2023, I proactively made a payment of R400 to my credit card account to address the arrears. However, on August 28th, Capitec Bank debited an amount of R500.86 from my account without prior notice or authorization. I promptly contacted a consultant at your credit department to request the reversal of this unauthorized debit. To my surprise, the consultant informed me that they were unable to reverse the payment due to the absence of a payment arrangement.

I then proceeded to make a payment arrangement on August 28th, clearly stating that I would commit to making a monthly payment of R500.00 going forward. It was highly distressing to discover on September 3rd, 2023, that Capitec Bank had once again debited my account, this time an amount of R500.86, despite the payment arrangement I had made just days earlier.

Frustrated by these unauthorized debits and the inability of Capitec Bank's consultants to provide a satisfactory resolution, I visited the Capitec branch located in Howard Center,pinelands, Cape Town. on September 3rd, 2023. Sadly, the consultant at the branch could not offer any assistance and was forced to contact your head office. While on a call with a collections consultant, I experienced extreme rudeness and unhelpfulness. I was told that nothing could be done because I did not have a payment arrangement, which was clearly incorrect since I had made one on August 28th. I requested to speak with a team leader or manager, but the consultant refused to escalate the matter.

The situation escalated further when another unauthorized debit of R600 occurred on the night of September 4th, 2023, adding to my growing frustration and anger.

My experience with Capitec Bank's customer service, both at the branch and over the phone, has been nothing short of appalling. The lack of knowledge about your bank's own policies and products, combined with unprofessional behavior, has left me feeling utterly helpless and mistreated.

I am now left with no choice but to escalate this matter further and seek resolution and compensation for the distress, inconvenience, and unauthorized debits I have endured. I urge you to thoroughly investigate this issue, review the recorded calls, and take immediate corrective action to rectify these errors and address the inadequacies in your customer service.

I expect a swift response and resolution to this matter, as well as an explanation for the ongoing unauthorized debits. My faith in Capitec Bank's ability to manage my accounts has been severely shaken, and I hope that you can rectify this situation promptly.

Regards

I went back to the branch on Friday 1 September 2023 to ask them to close the account, but I was told I need to settle the account which is now having a negative balance because of these *****ulent transactions which keep bouncing. I do not understand why I need to pay for the charges if this transaction is *****ulent. To me it seems like our information is not safe with Capitec Bank and now I am responsible for their lack of safety. I will never use Capitec again and I am going to escalate this matter since I did not get help from their ***** department. I was just asked what do I want to happen and now they are making this my problem. Please just close this damn account because I will not pay a cent. The account would not be on a negative balance If the first consultant who assisted me did things right.

I did not receive any notifications for these online purchases. I opened a ***** case with Capitec and received a reference number. I was told that Capitec ***** team could not go back more than two months into my account, which I told the branch agent that I have never heard of such. Now Capitec returned money for the transaction, which confirms that they agree the transactions are *****ulent because it is from one merchant. Now I am struggling to get further assistance from Capitec. Capitec must not rob us and think we are not aware of our rights and that they have insurance for such *****ulent cases, the ******** hacked their system, I did nothing because my card was still with me.

2023/09/04 08:29,Robin N,***** Case Incident,"On the morning of July 27, 2023, at approximately 09:15 AM, I found myself in a distressing incident involving a hijacking and hostage situation. The perpetrators not only took possession of my vehicle but also held me captive in their vehicle for approximately 3 hours transporting me to a different location.

During this incident, they forcibly gained access to my mobile phone and extracted my bank card from my wallet. I was subsequently threatened with violence, with the threat of being shot, if I did not comply with their demands to unlock my phone and provide them with the necessary information to access my banking account.

In response to this unfortunate situation, I promptly reported the incident as a case of ***** submitting an affidavit on the 31 July 2023. Seeking clarity on the progress of the investigation, I visited one of the Capitec branches. Regrettably, on 24 August 2024 the feedback I received from the bank's ***** division via a staff member at one of their branches indicated that it was perceived that I had willingly and voluntarily shared the pertinent details with my captors, leading to the conclusion that I would not be eligible for a refund.

It is deplorable and reprehensible how the bank has handled this matter clearly professionalism and client service and for that matter their reputation is irrelevant.

While this was posted on Hello Peter on 28 August 2023 there is yet no feedback. It has now become clear that one's life is irrelevant and insignificant regardless of the fact one's life is in danger",1,1,"Good day Robin Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/09/02 10:57,Gertrude N,Missing Funds,"On the 5th of July 2023 I went to Kwa Thema school branch to transfer the money to pay for my grandson's school fees(CEC), A lady by the door assisted me to do the transfer on their self service machine.At that time I did not have any account number with me as it was not for the first time transferring money to the school I did a transfer of R3 600 in July 2022 to the same account.

3 weeks later the school called me to say my grandson's school fees is in arrears, and I explained to them that I transferred R8 000 on the 5th of July and the school said they will double check for me, they came back to me and explained that no money was received from me. 

On the 5th of August I then went to the branch to enquire as to what happened to my money, as I thought the school was paid. Sadly I couldn't find answers as to what happened to my money, I have been going to the bank almost every week and all I am told is they are still investigating.

Mind you on the 5th of August I was told that the investigation will take 2week,but now the investigation is prolonging and I don't get proper answers as to what happened to my money and when am I getting it.

My frustration is my grandson will be expelled from school on Monday, because the school was understanding from July. Please help me to get to the bottom of this, in finding answers on what happened to my money.",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Gertrude N can view this message.",2023-09-02 12:14:12
2023/09/02 10:26,Siyanda M,Capitec doesn't care about their clients,"I called the Client Care number and an agent by the name of Mbali Makhubo attended to my call and i initially advised that my credit rating is bad but I want Capitec to take a risk on me as I am in dire need of a loan and I have been banking with them since 2014 i have a life threatening situation that requires money. I requested that she takes my application to a credit manager or risk review manager to access. She then said she will do the application online. She did and it declined. I advised that I knew that it will decline that is what I advised at the start of the call. But further explained to her that my salary comes into the Capitec account and I want Capitec to take a risk on me. She then accused me of shouting and I requested that I speak to her superior but she said they will call me back as she has other clients that she must attend to. To my dismay, she is more focused on other clients than me than me, meaning she is not prioritizing the client she has on the call because my application declined. After insisting that I will hold she then put me through to Sikhumbuzo Zwane who identified himself as a Team Leader who my conversation with him was not fruitful as he refused to provide me with either a contract number or email address of the credit department. A bank that I have banked with for 14 years is not able to take a risk on me with just R50K. They would rather see me dead than assist in a life threatening situation. I don't think I will ever support such a bank and will ensure that none of the people that I am close to does business with such a bank who cannot care in desperate time of need.",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Siyanda M can view this message.",2023-09-02 12:13:09

2023/09/01 10:46,Yolande Van der Watt ,VERY POOR SERVICE FROM CAPITEC,"On 8 August 2023 we opened an Incident at Capitec in Potchefstroom,  on 28 August 2023 they notified us via sms they closed Incident because the did not receive info needed, WHICH THEY NEVER ASKED FROM US.

As we are situated 60km from town, we made a special trip to town to get the necessary forms and send them to the ***** Department as was told by the Capitec Branch after visiting them again yesterday, just to find out they have no clue of what's going between the bank and the ***** Department.   After sending the forms and phoning several times, Maria Tekana, REFUSED to assist my wife with the matter as I have appointed my wife as the mediator and CEO of all my administrative and financial issues.

Capitec have very POOR customer service!!

I am not have with the service I received from Bree street Branch Jhb, I went into the branch there was no one at the door to give us correct query cards so I decided to press tranact and got ticket number 101, then I sat down, I saw a lady wearing a yellow jersey a dookie and Jeans, she was standing by the door I went to go ask tell her about my app situation and she said open the app as i was opening it she turned and spoke to one of the guys behind the desk then she left me and proceeded to fetch some papers without saying a word to me, then I decided to go sit, thwn she too the papers to one of the client who was sitting by the branches and after assisting her she just went back to the door and I was looking at her.
The next thing because our eyes were locked and I guess out of guilt she calls me and I was furious because I was left like a piece of **** because I was not that important to her, then I began to vent my anger then she was speaking back trying to defend her actions and I asked for her name badge and guess what she just went to fetch it and threw it with attitude on the table,and I said to her you should have simply said that i was busy with another client I am just standing here waiting for her papers to print so the papers are ready let me attend to her then i will come back to you, thats all, I started swearing saying this is **** bank and left to go cool off,
Upon my return i approached another and she asked me what is the issue I asked what is the name of this lady as I want sure she was Dikeledi she confirmed it and I said where is the branch manager I need to speak to her now, This lady Sherly said she is not available she offered to take my numbers to give to the manager, then she apologized for everything and went on to assist me,.. please view the footage and if this is the kind of attitude you teach your staff to treat us then I will be part of a company that seea nothing wrong with  customer service, I have made a decision that why keep my money with a brand that does not care, you charging us even for looking at our bank cards charge for rlentering pin wrong charge us for withdrawing at capitec ATM charge us huge amounts for sending money and still charge them for receiving money yen cherry on top you give us Dikeledi to help us with stinking and appalling attitude, as if I was asking money from her

Again my call was transferred from one department to another until eventually a call center agent answered, but she was merrily chatting away to someone else. EVENTAULLY she acknowledged my call, and when I related my query to her, she again repeated the standard acknowledgement - ""Good day, you are through to..."". And this happens every time I call, for whatever reason. Gosh, I am so frustrated with this bank that I'm seriously considering changing banks!

2023/08/29 10:19,FAZEL,Capitec ATM problem and rude call Centre staff,"On Sunday 27/08 the Capitec ATM at Ballito Lifestyle Centre Mall (Centre ATM) I tried to withdraw R3000 with my FNB. The machine went through all the motions as if it's giving the money without reporting any error. I could here the counter inside spinning continuously but no money was dispensed and the machine went back to normal use. This money was deducted from my FNB account.
I called the call Centre and spoke to Lindani, explaining all this so she could log a dispute. If that branch gets the report, reviews cameras, checked the money in the ATM etc. then they will see the problem easily. Lindani refused to help, arrogantly saying I should contact my bank. She didn't understand that it was the Capitec machine with a fault. When she continued being rude I asked for her surname which she refused to give. Is this the quality of staff Capitec hires? There are many people that are jobless yet very qualified to handle this task efficiently. I hope that this matter can be investigated with this branch concerning this ATM by reporting it here as Capitec call centres seem to hire unqualified, uncouth, arrogant and unprofessional people. I fact while talking to her, a guy at the next door ATM had a similar experience but in his case the machine gave a slip with some sort of error. Please help, Capitec can check camera footage, ATM balance etc. so my bank can reverse my funds. I will gladly change this to a positive review with 5 stars, all I ask for is an investigation into this matter. Hopefully Capitec can look into the lack of professionalism displayed by Lindani who was impatient and not willing to listen or help.

The number of charges on each and every transaction deems the relationship unworkable.

I'm unemployed and to have the little support received from family members stripped to almost nothing due to bank charges, is almost unfair and not viable.

All of my family members have since left the bank, and this month is the last one I am also using it.

2023/08/29 00:05,Nokuthula N,This is a bank that cares less about their customers,"Once upon a time in 2017, I’ve is the was running my own business .My customers would order from me and pay me, and then I sent their product to their doorstep .These were people referred to my by friend ,family members or peopl that had done business with me before ,so they trusted me.With this particular customer though it was the same procedure until after some time I realised that the R10000 she had sent to me I could no access  so i went to the bank to find out why and shockingly I was told that the person who sent me the money called in to reverse the money saying she/she had sent the money to the wrong person so they froze the money till I would agree that I was actually the wrong person. I couldn't believe this at 1st till they actually called the person and she just said yes it was the wrong person and she didn't even want to hear another story. After that day, she never again answered my calls, and so-called capitec never released my money.now I sit with an account that forever reflects that I have R11,000 even though I only have  a R1000 in my account. Is this not cruelty for a bank to do so for many years not even considering the fact that we bank with them coz we trust them with our money?it's my hard earned money but the bank refuses to release it even after so many years when that person has never even returned to them asking for her money or even proof that it was realy a mistake. I'm even sure that this person has done such too many other people and may have gotten away with it too...question is...ARE WE REALY ENTRUSTING OUR MONEY TO SUCH A VENERABLE  BANK What more can they do even if they can block you from your own money for years? They don't even check up on their customers for normal traffic to their bank coz I believe another bank would have noticed this and fixed probably within 72h of the incident...CAPITEC JUST DOES NOT CARE AND I SAY THIS AFTER 5 YEARS OF BEGGING FOR MY MONEY",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I understood a client was concerned and laid a complaint. I was requested to send an affidavit thru and did so. I did not hear from the bank again and assumed it was paid back to the client. This evening i came to pay for my dinner just to see my accounts missing. I called your call center and was advised its for the same R4000 that was paid to me. Now i do not understand how now 2 months later my account gets blocked for the same R4000 that was removed from my account.

2023/08/28 11:33,Nolithemba,Refund,"On the 25/08/2023 I deposited R2400 to account number **********, account holder's name : M Moatshe for my son's student accommodation no.5 Lindley Street Sasolburg. After making that deposit the landlord asked me to deposit another R550 that was not included in lease agreement and that's where I realised that It's a ****.
I rushed to Rosebank Capitec bank on the same day and reported the incidents. Capitec bank instructed me to come with affidavit from the police station and case number. I submitted the affidavit and case number on Saturday'26th. I then received an sms confirmation from Capitec notifying me that they are investigating my query but I was not given a time frame . They said they do not know how long this will take . At that time my son is stranded at Sasolburg (Flavius Mareka TVET College) and I don't have money to look for other accommodation as my money will only be paid after their investigation.

The person who received the payment also had the nerve to message me and tell me that she knows I had her account blocked ,her father works for Capitec and has since opened another account for her, she is now using that . She even had the audacity to ask me to send more money to her .
I feel like Capitec is dragging their feet although the person has been flagged . For them to send me a message with no time frame is really unacceptable . I have fallen prey to a **** and they are dragging their feet in helping .

2023/08/28 09:32,Anil J,Capitec Bank - Zero Client support,"On 15 August 2023 I received a notification from my service provider that they have not been able to process my subscription for the month. I then checked on my account and fond the transaction failed. I attempted to process a manual online payment for the subscription using my virtual card and this failed, then tried my usual debit card and this failed as well. I then called Capitec and spent almost 20 minutes on the phone with a support consultant who had to put me on hold so she could ask someone else to check what is the cause of the problem....keeping in mind that this subscription was running smoothly for the past two years....she gets back to me and says that there was an update on their system and the service provider has been flagged as a ***** / online casino / forex trading company . She will get the relevant department to assist to clear this error. I waited and got no call to update me on their progress...on 16 August I attempt the transactions and its the same issue, this is now 19 hours after my initial phone call to Capitec customer service. I report the matter via a DM on Twitter and they reply that someone will look into the matter. On 21 August the transaction is still not able to be processed and I 'm now reminded by the service provider that they will be cancelling my service should I not bring the account up to date. I then chat to the bot / human??? on the Capitec whatsapp line and I screenshot the chats and submit it to the Twitter DM...they then ask ""How may we assist"" yet I have furnished them with the information regarding the problems being experienced. I send them more  screenshots, this time with the progress report of the matter, which still shows the matter is being investigated, ie. 5 days gone by and still not resolved. So it's been a waste of my time, costs fo around R75 airtime to call them to sort out a problem that their system created and no feedback and not even a courtesy call to advise what is going on. When I called them again, I was told that they cannot call me back and I would need to call again the next day to get a progress report. 

Totally fed up and not having received a confirmation that they will sort out their mess I make mention to Capitec advising them of my intention to close my accounts with them. I proceeded to look at other banks as an option and I log a request for a call with FNB online and within a minute a consultant calls me, I'm serious, a minute after logging the request I get the call and the lady asks very politely ""How may we assist you."" I then tell her I would like to open up a personal and business account with FNB and after a few minutes everything is in process and the account confirmation is emailed to me. Now this is proper service, making you feel welcome to bank with such an institution...A compliment definitely worth mention for efficient and professional service provided by FNB Bank. As for Capitec, I have still not received an update on the matter hence I am now closing both my accounts with them as of 31 August 2023.",1,1,"Good day Anil Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/08/28 09:28,Hennie V,Capitec refuse to refund customer on *****ulent transactions.,"My phone was ****** in May 2023.  The previous day my daughter was in an accident where her cellphone was ****** on site.  The next day I was assaulted and my phone ******.  That evening I realised there was money going out of my account.  I could not phone Capitec as I had no way of contacting them.  I went to the bank the next day and was there when they opened.  R18,500 was withdrawn from my account.  Now Capitec just pull up the shoulders and do not want to reimburse the money that was ******.  Their security system is terrible as they told me my pin was compromised.  The app was hacked and Capitec refuse to admit it, stating that it is impossible.  Before you decide to move to Capitec think long and hard as their security is not up to scratch, they don't care about their clients and instead of owing up to their mistake I have to take the loss which is unacceptable.

2023/08/25 13:54,ziyaad,Capitec 41 days of turmoil before returning what was rightfully mine unapologetically or without any compensation.,"I would love to share my 41 days of turmoil, sleepless nights negativity, complacent investigation, and nearly a loss of R14000 without any compensation or apologies and I believe strongly that if I wasn't persistent it would have been left at my loss.
 I have to add, during that time I was in the midst of purchasing a vehicle and lost that deal.... 
Now let me elaborate.. 

On the 15th of July at approximately 16:15 pm found myself going to a capitec ATM inside Goodwood mall to deposit a rather large sum of money of which when I attempted to deposit the money I would have needed to split the sum of money into smaller denominations to have it accepted by the ATM so my first attempt was R14000 which I proceeded to do the deposit as prompted by the ATM, firstly inserting my card, following with my PIN number and options selections for deposit to which them cash envelope hole opened and I inserted R14000 to which it then closed and showed processing without any sound of the machine actually processing cash as the machines normally tend to do in the machine and the screen was frozen and nothing happening for approximately several minutes to which my card then came out of the machine and the machine then stated deposit rejected of which no cash came returning to me and then I waited another few minutes for the cash to be returned of which nothing happened I then inserted my card but the machine now showed deposits not allowed on the machine with a red Cross over deposits emblem. I then started panicking  and had the balance of Cash still at hand to which I realised that no deposit slip was given by the machine and thought it to be wise at the time to deposit the balance of the cash into my account on another ATM and use that deposit slip as some sort of indication that I was indeed at this ATM and that went successfully and got the deposit slip as proof of my deposit for the remaining balance but my R14,000 was still in the firts ATM machine and the ATM machine could no longer take deposits as there was a clear indication of an era on this ATM machine I then took a photograph of this ATM machine with the indication of no deposit allowed as extra evidence. 
Unfortunately my phone at the time could not make any calls although, I took a photograph of the customer care number on the side of the machine and immediately raced home so that I could call customer care and log this incident to which I did and received a incident number. 

As the incident happened on a Saturday afternoon and the banks were closed, immediately the first working day I went to the branch where this incident happened and made a complaint there as well and had another incident number to which they said they would investigate the incident and wait for the outcome from G4S as this is the company that retrieves the funds out of the ATM. After several days I received a call from capitec and to my surprise informed me that  they findings are negative and capitec is rejecting my claim with an outcome of ""NO FUNDS OF MY CLAIM WAS FOUND"". I then refused to accept their findings told to me by the consultant calling me,  I could not accept this as I was infact the person that experienced the issue and I did the deposit to my account and I witness that this incident did in fact with all my evidence happen to me and I will not accept the loss of R14000 Rand to which he then suggested that he could forward me the ombudsman's details and I could take it up with them as the consultant could verify looking at my profile that everything I stated with my claim other than the funds all checked out and he could verify I had made those other deposits at the time as well and ""I do frequent deposits "" , he could indeed verify this. According to Consultant...
With this being said he forwarded me the email with the on Batman's details but instead, I personally went into the branch and spoke to the manager who was very helpful by the name of Michael. ( I must state that out of the whole lot from capitec Michael was the most helpful and understanding.)
Michael had mentioned that his previous department he used to work at was customer complaints, and with me disputing it he knew exactly how to escalate my claim and forward it to the necessary departments for them to investigate it further. 
With that being said within a few days I was contacted and new investigating officer and the new incident number and the investigating officer by the name of ""Given"". ( ironically has my money was taken) 😂 
Given then immediately gave me the same response as initially presented to me by the first agent that my claim was rejected as the machine had no funds in access of R14000 (note this is now the second time my claim was rejected) I then told him ""I would not accept it"" as previously and I Began explaining the scenario step by step and with him taking him through the whole entire incident. He then acknowledged that when the incident happened, I used this machine along with another to do the deposits and by his reaction to this new information to his investigation wasn't aware of me using another machine. 
I then came to the conclusion that they investigated the wrong machine (to which i found it to be extremely complacent). 
As this information was presented initially with my description of the incident the first time) which he then told me and then they would investigate further as the new information could have possibly a different outcome. At this point I was highly stressed and and Mr Given... then said he will call me back after a few days of further investigating to which several days past and I was still not contacted I then went to Mr Michael the branch manager and told him about our conversation with Mr Given.. then I made several attempts to leave a message with Mr Given... to contact me back. Mr Michael told me he would be taking an absence of leave for the next two weeks to which he had a few days available before that and said he would try and sort this out before he took his leave takes place, of which nothing transpired. Michael was now on his 2 weeks leave.... in this time I couldn't get hold of Given and left messages with the consultants on several attempts. 
Eventually after the 2 weeks had now past, I managed to get hold I've Given to which he concluded that still no funds were found (the third rejection to my incident) and the next best thing would be to take this matter further with the ombudsman and Mr Given  would as per legalities have to draught a letter for me stating the findings to which I submit this to the ombudsman with my claims and they would do any further investigation on the incident and scrutinising both parties and come up with their own outcome. I then waited several days for Mr Given... to get back to me and every attempt to call him I would be told by the consultants conveying message from him that he would call me back and yet I received no call. 
I then went back to the branch on Monday the 23rd of August and got Mr Michael there after his return of his two weeks leave to which he'd inform me that Mr Given had also been on leave but he had spoken to Mr Given that very morning and had told me that Given was in the process of drafting the letter for the Ombudsman. He had been told by Mr Given that they did further investigations yet couldn't find an surplus of funds at the ATM  Machines but rather a deficit of funds as this was Mr Michaels words 🧐. 
This was very puzzling yet my mind couldn't rest as they couldn't find my R14,000 rand and the ATM machines totals work at a deficit which is very, very pecu**** and strange as how does an ATM machine calculate a amount total of funds and it doesn't add up to the exact amount but less. This being said should raise some sort of concern. 
The following day next day, i went back to Mr Michael and told him that I found it very strange yet they have concluded that there is no such funds of mine but not questioning why the total amounts are less then what is supposed to be and besides the fact that my R14,000 should make a excess in the amounts in the ATM machines. This all seemed extremely suspicious and it wasn't adding up. I
Insisted that they hurry up with the drafting of the letter so that I could submit it to the ombudsman as they have now taken 40 days and yet no outcome has been established on my side other than they cannot account for my funds and my claim. 
They could see how determined I was and how I wanted to take this up with the ombudsman. 
I then received a call on the very next day from Given on the 23rd of August stating that they all the machines in question and finalize that no funds was found as per all the investigation that they've done previously and now and a quote that he said all the ATMs were balancing despite me knowing that there was a deficit in the balancing of the ATMs funds to which I brought it to his attention. As i quote I mentioned to him that ""I beg to differ"" when he  told me that ""all the machines are balanced and there was no findings of my fundsto which I've claimed"" . He wasn't aware that I had now gathered information that his machine was in a deficit after the investigation and I could tell that he was shocked to find that I knew this information and I insisted that he sent me the letter as soon as possible so that I could proceed with the ombudsman and I made it known that they had dragged it out this long despite me reaching out after a month, To the Mall Manager of Goodwood mall to try and retrieve some footage of me at the ATM to which she mentioned that unfortunately due to the duration of time that has passed that footage has already been overwritten. I also inquired if any enquiries were made prior to me from the bank on some footage of this incident and if she was aware of it to which she rep**** no ""no one has inquired"" . 
Mr Given then told me I would get the letter later that day to which I received nothing and I was about to call him this morning on the 24th of August to which I suddenly received a deposit in my account of R14000 ( and charged for deposit fees.)
 With call about 30 minutes later from Mr Given, now stating that ""they had a discussion with the branch manager ( Mr Michael) and went through their data again and found ( mysteriously if I might add) my R14,000 which I claim for 41 days ago. 
Extremely relieved I thank Mr Given.. and he ask me if there was anything else he could assist me with. To which I rep**** I was just happy to receive what was rightfully mine. Thats all.. No apology, no compensation for loss or grief or for sleepless nights and especially for the turmoil they put me through. Just my R14000 of which you rejected so many times and made me feel like I was a ******. (Less my deposit fee.) 
Thank you capitec... if I had not persistent you would have had my R14,000 and I would have had to just move on.. 
Im so grateful and i thank tje Almighty creator, for getting me back what was taken from me, and what was rightfully mine and with my battle trying to do all this time that indeed I was a victim in this case. I've also lost so much in the process. 
So please all members of the public do yourself a favour, try and have some sort of recording and don't take it for granted. Make an effort to ensure your deposit at an ATM machine with capitec or any other bank. This was a life lesson to me. Clearly this method and system is flawed.

7 Branch visits and 29 calls JUST for today!! 

I have not used my account since 2020. 
Today I went to check if my account is still active and if I can start using it again! 
To my surprise I have seen I am in R2 650.00 in the credit HOWEVER the account is STOPED due to a ***** block. 

There is where the trouble started absolutely NO one at the branch nor on the call centre can answer me to why the account is blocked. 

The branched advised I should do an affidavit together with certifying my ID. 
Once they have requested it. I immediately went to do so. Took the papers to the bank . Once again told me not even them can understand this situation. 

However this can maybe take 3 WEEKS or more to be resolved!! 

I bank with Private Clients at another bank and I just noticed once again today WHY I have moved my banking!! 

The reason for me urgently needed to use my Capitec account is due to funds needed to be transferred for a surgery!! 

I have logged a case with the banking ombud today. Hopefully they will get back to me sooner than capitec!

I went to the branch immediately after I discovered that I had transferred money to an account that I did not know, they said that they were going to contact this person, after one attempt they told me that they could not get hold of this person and I had to go to the police and open a case. I decided to call that customer number myself, I was told that I was going to be charged R 7 for them to call this person, I was put on hold and afterwards told that they could not assist me because this person has withdrawn the money from that account, as such no assistance. What a let down, failed me completely.",1,1,"Good day Ziyanda Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/08/24 11:21,Adrian P,*********** staff /Misleading Information,"I needed a debicheck mandate canceled against a *****ulent company that had ****med me .

Upon my arrival to this branch, I raised my concern to an employee that was issuing tickets into the bank .He then told me that Capitec is unable to do this. I then questioned him, unable to answer he gave me a ticket for futher assistance.

The bank had just opened  so I was assigned to a consultant within 5 minutes. 
I raised my concern again. The consultant he immediately said we need a cancelation letter from the *****ulent company. I have attached screenshots of the information provided by the Capitec website to its clients regarding canceling a debicheck mandate.They don't include this information. Due to this misinformation 
I couldn't be helped at that time .

 The consultant tried to call the *****ulent company (Their contact information was found from my Capitec banking app) after failing to cancel anything from his  computer desktop.

 He then said ""The debit date was for 23rd of August and it didn't go out , you shouldn't worry because today is the 24th of August"".

I then explained the term Tracking to him. 
He then said ""That's nothing come back if they take the money out your account we can then dispute it"".

I'm certain that I've been mislead by *********** Employees that show no empathy to their client's. 

I now have to wait for a *****ulent company to debit my account  in order to helped? 

This will definitely be my last month using Capitec Bank. I will also never recommend their service to anyone.",1,1,"Good day Adrian Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

What I fail to understand is, I never gave those people permission let alone buy furniture on credit or whatever they sell. I have been a nursing student from July 2018 - June 2023 earning a stipend of R1500 how on earth could I have been afforded credit. I even told the lady to check both my accounts if she thinks I'm misleading her. It's frustrating and appalling that a company had access to my account and a debit order was loaded in 2021, October 20th and now I must call the company to remove it, how is that possible? As the people supposed to remove it is the bank I'm banking with, otherwise it means anyone can do about anything they like with our accounts. I am done with Capitec, now that I'm a qualified Nurse I will be closing my account tomorrow to go to a safer and better bank that won't be giving authorization to whomever they choose without my permission.

I’m disappointed in how Capitec has not been able to assist with a claim I did on the 15/08/2023 for a claim Ref;**********25 Cause of death was unnatural, I submitted all requested documents and I’m not receiving any positive outcome and according to my understanding is that as it falls under unnatural death (accidental)is that I should have received the first amount of the claim and after investigation that is when the outcome will determine if it will be double payment or not depending on the outcome of investigation which I’m not so concerned about .I’m very furious because it contradicts what is explained to clients when granting the policy . I have had this policy from 2018 until now . I went to the branch in Cresta on 22/08 and was assist by a lady named Courtney ,she was able to assist by only sending an email to the funeral claims department and advised that will give me feedback.  Capitec should give clarity because they now request a form filled which was filled and an inquest report that Capitec should liase with the investigator officer stated on the police report .

On the 10th of August 2023 I went to Hammarsdale branch to open a business account. I filled up the forms they gave me and provided all the documents they requested but until now no one has given me feedback.

I then tried to apply online, a lady called Rebone Mabilu sent me the forms to fill, I told her the form she sent me is locked I cannot edit and sign, she then asked for documents, and I provided her on the 17th of August 2023, after that she kept quiet.

I called yesterday which is 5 days later and requested to speak to her, a lady that answered said she was busy on a call but send her an inhouse message requesting her to call me, after hours without her calling I called again and the lady that answered said she had left for the day and advised me to send her a message of which I did.

After realizing that there was no reply on my message I followed up with a call again today, the lady who answered said she is busy on another line and asked for my number again to give to Rebone's supervisor, I gave her, after a few minutes she sent a mail saying that my forms were not completed and sent again, the same one that I informed her on the 17th that it was locked.

2023/08/21 14:05,Vanessa W,ALL STEPS HAD BEEN FOLLOWED AND THE SYSTEM WAS JUST ABOUT TO ACCEPT AND THEN IT FROZE. ????,"Here we go again...
Amongst all that your systems have failed, once again.
 4 month in the making.
This week whilst  the credit department was working on my case which took about a week to process. I was asked to submit documents of which I did and then it was in the final processing stage. I received a call late Friday afternoon as well as my office did to confirm my employment. We were in the final stages of which 3 offers had been presented and then we moved on to accept 2 of the offers only to have your system freeze on us and me holding on for about 10m minutes. The consultant then came back on the phone to say that she had to submit the documents to the credit department and I was happy to assist and be patient. Within a half hour I got an sms saying it was declined, once again...  How is this possible if the application was minutes from being processed with no hassles at all.

See the reference number 3DC8NTG84CAB:

2023/08/17 19:49,Anita ,Disappointed no accommodations for unpaid maternity leave,"In February & March I notified Capitec and all my other debt places like Nedbank/MFC , Vodacom & Capital Legacy that I will be going on unpaid maternity leave from April. I did not receive any income and still busy with my UIF claim. All proof was send to them.

The credit card department has been so mean and so rude and not to even speak about they contact you and you need to hold on for them and if you answer they want to know how they can help you but they phoned you. After numerous explanations that I will only get a salary end of August they continue to intimidate me and threaten me with legal action. When you explain to them you situation they just dont care they make you feel like **** and then you cant talk to them because they do not listen.

I have never skipped a payment I have been with them for more than 7 years and they could not even accommodate me like all my other debt providers in giving me a break and getting myself together after having a baby. They just want my money. I even took my last food money to make a payment to let them stop harassing me.

They treated me very unkind and I will never forget this I kept on telling them that I do not have money and will make payment once my salary comes in they emotionally damaged me and to make things worse I had to borrow money from my employer to pay them and they cant even clear my credit score they can rune you but they cant fix things when they receive your money.

This is the last I will finish my accounts with them and close it they are so heartless and *********.

They cannot even phone to say thank you for the payment butting me in more debt than I already am.

I will never recommend Capitec Bank.

I cannot even imagine what single moms that has no any support system do if Capitec did this to them this is so emotionally stressful as we all know how our economic is these days.

2023/08/17 10:08,Lin B,*****ulent transactions in my account has led to broken trust,On the 26 June I had 3 *****ulent transactions go through my account at the same time.  I immediately called Capitec as I had definitely not made these 3 transactions which had the same prefix in their description but were for 3 different things (one said cell phone the other said vehicle repairs and the 3rd was for something else - they all started with the initials ITI followed by the description). The total amount of the 3 transactions was R4500. Nobody can afford to lose that amount of money. After numerous follow ups and constant calling and actually going to the branch I managed to get hold of someone really nice who assisted me in their Complaints dept.  They came back to me today to say that since a Google Play OTP was used to authorise these transactions (It was NOT done by me by the way as if I had to state that) they can't give me the money back.  And it took them 2 months to tell me that and numerous calls from me. I'm now scared to even make any payments online - and trust me when I say I'm a huge online shopper - and I even make purchases on Facebook.  Well thanks Capitec for ruining that for me too because I no longer trust that my money is safe in my Capitec account that I've had for about 15 years. I'm horrified at their response to this issue and honestly feel like I no longer trust Capitec to sit the right way on a toilet. I'm devastated that they have offered me no refunds on the money *****ulently removed from my account and it took more than 2 months for them to decide this. Trust is broken and I'm not sure I can come back from this.  My WHOLE family have Capitec accounts. Now we just don't feel safe.,1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I have banked with Capitec for 10 years and used the account purely for savings. Through the ****, I lost just about all my savings.  I reported the incident immediately and opened a case with SAPS.  Capitec promises you feedback within 14-21 days of reporting your incident. After waiting patiently for 21 days, with one word of feedback via phone, email or even an SMS, I started calling the customer service centre daily.  Every phone call started with the same questions such as if I had opened a SAPS case and if I had sent my affidavit.  I was advised that less than half of my money had been recovered and investigations were on going.  From day 25-30, after every call I was promised a call back from the customer service agent which I never received.  I went into my local branch multiple times and they too were not able to assist me. Eventually, at day 47 after my incident, still without one word of feedback, I paid my branch another visit in desperation.  I was promised a call back which I have now received at day 49.  The outcome is I will be refunded what was recovered (Less than half what was ******) and its in essence my own fault as the *****ulent transactions were approved by my cell phone so there is nothing they can do to help me.  All this after 49 days of anxiety waiting for answers to an investigation. At this point, I would like to add that the ********s who ****med me knew ALL my personal details.  Not once did I give out my pin or ID number.  They knew every transaction in my account and my exact balances.  They knew the last transactions dont through the account.  Unless this is an inside job, I fear how weak Capitec security must be for this kind of breach!  At the end of the call, I was advised to contact the banking ombudsman if I was unsatisfied with the outcome and they went as far as to SMS me all the details for the Ombudsman.  I feel violated by this bank and very unfairly treated.  My family have already closed their accounts at Capitec and I would advise anyone to avoid this bank AT ALL COSTS!!! It all goes well until there is any issue....then you are on your own and GOOD LUCK!",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/08/16 20:26,Siphindile N,Angry customer,"I'm a very angry customer right now. In April 2023 I also my job due to retrenchment. In May I claimed from insurance and my claim was approved. An sms was sent saying ""Your claim is approved, we'll make 12 monthly installment. Should you be employed during this period, a partial monthly payment would be made for 12 months"" Ti my surprise only an amount of R367 × 6 was made in 1 day. When I called to enquire about why R367 because I've never had an installment of R367, my installment has always been above R900 depending on how much I owe. As usual, no one gave me answers I was sent from pillar to post. I called last month and was told to write an affidavit stating that I'm still not working, I did that but to this day no payment has been made and no one is saying anything. This is ruining my credit score and I regret the day I took this credit card. You've lost a valuable and loyal customer capitec.

All of a sudden without warning my money is being withheld because of a form I needed to fill out. No one informed me. I would have done it way prior to depositing the money.

Now I have to wait. No one can give me a turnaround time. This is my livelihood.

2023/08/16 13:08,Ella S,"Xenophobia, ****** treatment","It is with a heavy heart as l write this review. On The 29/07/2023 my Flat mate transferred Rent Money into my Bank Account (Capitec Bank) and a few days later (03/08/2023) my Bank Account got blocked. I then called Capitec to find out what happened only to be told that it was due *****ulent transfer from my flat mate. Later on discovered that the same Flat mate had transferred money to another flat mate. We then visited the branch in Bayside Table View (Capitec) and we were directed on what was needed to be done, which we did submit all the required documents and affidavits. My submission was done 08/08/2023 with Incident #**********41, #**********31,#**********57,#**********1,#**********01, #**********31 all these incidents number where follow ups from day 1 of submission only to be sent from one Pilar to another without any good reason. The flat mate who had sent the rent from her FNB account had gone to her FNB Bank to submission affidavit to clear my involvement in any *****ulent activity. (Her incident # 2********** FNB) My surprise came in when the other flat mate with ( incident # **********95,#**********13,#**********01 Capitec) Had her Bank Account unblocked. When i followed up the Branch manager Capitec Bayside (Kelcy Pedro) said they can't do anything about it. Which didn't make sense why my Bank account is still blocked and the other open as the sender is to both our Account is the same person. 
Only to sense xenophobia, ****** seeing that I am a Zimbabwean and the other flat mate is South African. When l mentioned this they didn't show any remorse to my plea on why my case is different from my other flat mate. Funny enough l have been Banking with Capitec for over 5 years and salary is paid into that Account. 
I feel not enough was to done to clear my name from the *****ulent activity. 
Is this how far xenophobia, ****** has come to. Are we Zimbabweans not contributing positively to the economy for us who are here legally.

My question is why such treatment to a fellow human being. What happened to a Rainbow nation that we always hear.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I was a victim of ***** on my Capitec Credit Card. Within an hour after I saw the transaction notification I rushed to the nearest branch to report the transaction and to block my card.
They issued me with a new card and blocked the compromised card.
Thereafter, ANOTHER EIGHT transactions went through on the ""blocked card"" over the following two days.
I went to the branch again to report it.
After waiting for 30 working days I called them today to find out if it has been resolved and they told me that I am liable and they will not refund the R4k+ that was ****** from me. No email no call nothing!
They also charged me for all the international processing fees on the 9 *****ulent transactions.
They told me that I gave a 1 time pin the day before the first transaction which makes it my fault and fair that 9 transactions were 'authorised' - ***?

They issued me with 2 new cards that was useless as both the card activation process was unsuccessful. after spending more than an hour in the branch and dealing with *********** staff that seems like they dont know what they're doing....I left just to get told I must come back on-another time as they need to call tech support as its a system issue. 


They were on the phone with your head office on the matter as well. So I ended up leaving after waisting my time, fuel and energy, left  with no NO CARD to USE as my one was blocked!!!!!!

2023/08/14 21:23,Carel V,Considerable amount of money hanging in mid air for 3 weeks.  No resolution - despite all my efforts,I booked plain tickets with Delta and went through all the steps to make a payment.  The money has been taken from my account but is currently hanging in mid air.  Delta never collected the funds and booked our airplane tickets.  I contacted Capitec that confirms they see the transaction but require a letter from Delta before they can release my money again.  Delta just keeps on saying that they cannot provide me with a letter as there has been no transaction and they have not collected the money.  Delta keeps on advising to contact my bank to release the money or wait until it falls off into our account again and the bank keeps on saying I need to ask Delta for a letter.  I am extremely frustrated that my funds have now been hanging in mid air for 3 weeks.  This has impacted my family in a huge way as our funds that we need to use to by tickets have been in midair.  I am also loosing out on interest on top of this on money that belongs to me and my bank that is not willing to assist me as the client with my money despite all the calls I have made and all the explanations I have provided.  I have even contacted master card that directs my call to Capitec and also no resolution.  I also received no reference numbers for my calls. There is just no interest in assisting me as the client with my money.   This has cost me more money as I need to phone from the US every time I need try and sort out this mess.  Please note my number is a US number and +1 is the country dial code that you need to place in front of the number to make a successful call.,1,1,"Good day CarelThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I phoned client care, I went to the branch several times until I decided to give up and let go for the sake of my mental well-being. Fairly recently Capitec send me messages that I'm over indebted and unilaterally reduced my Access Facility to Zero. Who told them that I am over indebted? What calculations did they perform to arrive to that conclusion? Lastly,  today I phoned client care to request a paid up letter, I was informed that I need to log into my app for verification, my App was not opening, I asked whether there is not other way we can do verification, other banks ask security questions. I was told that there is no way. So clients who do not have an app cannot be assisted by Client care. So I think that's it between me and Capitec, I don't think I'll ever get things done right for me.

I have been loyal and always kept up with what was expected from my bank but over the past 3 months now its been an absolute nightmare trying to resolve issues on my profile and loan applications. When I first app**** it was declined because of information that was incorrect on my profile and then three months later once all had been rectified I tried to apply again only to have it declined because of affordability, if only my bank went the extra mile and looked at my current loans, consolidated them and approved me for a new loan but no its easier for them to just decline and not even find a way out. You see they still gain because I am still paying my current loans. When I was earning way less I was approved for so much more credit than I am currently asking for . I just dont know where their loyalty lies.  I have written an email to them regarding this lets see how long they take to come back to me. In the interim I need to go to another institution that can assist me even after 15 years I am forced to go another way and build a new relationship. Capitec there is such a thing as an overide button and sometimes you can be more human in your clients needs then reliant on a computer that doesnt know how to sort out the real things in life.

Someone hacked my account and stole my money out of my account. 
Did all the steps with capiect and they still have the nerve to tell me they can not refund my money back the account that all myoney got gender to is clear as daylight but they still cant get my money back. This investigation when on since march up until now when i got feedback that they cant retrieve my money. A ***** that has been done without my knowledge. And to tip it of even more the way it was done from investigating myself it feels to me like this was an inside job. Cause when they told me my phone was used to access my banking app it made no sense cause i am ALWAYS on my phone,so it makes no sense. Why would i put myself in debt.

I have made numerous attempts to contact the bank up to now, no response or feedback. No attempt was even made to notify me of this ***** Claim that was made on my account. My concern is that people are getting paid this week, if their salaries bounce it will be a nightmare. Im pray somebody can please contact me. I am currently living and working abroad and I have spent so much money just trying to call back home to resolve this matter. My account had been frozen on the 7th of August and still no feedback.

2023/08/13 16:12,Ane W,My account frozen because of 1 payment that was made to me is apparently from a *****ulent account now my whole account and all my funds are frozen because of this?,Good day someone told me about hello Peter and I hope the I'll finally be helped as I've been back and forth to capitec and the police station on the 6th of August I went on my capitec app after a payment was made to me and I realized that my savings account was just not appearing so I went to the branch to go withdraw money so I could deposit it to my sister in law when at the atm it kept kicking out my card giving me an error so I ended up calling customer care then I was told that my account has been frozen as one payment that was made to me was made from a *****ulent account the amount was for R500 I was so upset that they would freeze all my funds and my account about this one payment I would understand if the only froze that 500 and kept going with the investigation but no they froze all my funds and my account.  Firstly I am an online companion and provide a personal service to all kinds of ppl I don't know them personally and how am I supposed to know who is busy with what kind of *****ulent activities I've been with capitec for 16 years and I have no part of any kind of *****ulent activities so they asked me to get an affidavit stating where the funds came from and a certified copy of my ID and I have done so I've taken it to the branch so they then said I should just wait for an sms from capitec I've been waiting for days and no response after being at the police station and the branch 3 times I then called capitec ***** line and I've explained that I've gotten the required documentation and sent it in but now they are expecting me to get proof of this payment from the client how am I supposed to do that there's no invoice as they asked because I don't own a business this is just a part of my own way of making a living is providing online companionship to ppl and yes the pay me for it where is my confidentiality in any of this its my own private things where I get my small income from here and there daily mostly these are just once of things that I chat with my ppl and then I don't here from them again but I then decided ok I'll take screenshots of my private chats with this person who apparently paid me from a *****ulent acc just so I can show it as proof of payment as on the chats we spoke about the amount and agreement for the private chats were about to have so I've sent that along with all other documentation to forensics@capitec and now I'm told that that's not proof of payment I need an invoice or something I've repeated myself so many times that I don't own a BUSINESS THIS WAS SOMEONE LIKE ALL OTHERS THAT CONTACTED ME ONLINE WHERE I POST MY PERSONAL SERVICES FOR ONLINE COMPANIONSHIP THAT MADE A PAYMENT TO ME FOR MY TIME AND ADVICE AND COMPANIONSHIP FOR THAT NEXT 30 MIN SO PLEASE TELL ME WHAT OTHER FORM OF PROOF OF PAYMENT I SHOULD GIVE I'm so embarrassed that I need to share my personal things just so I can try make capitec understand that there's no way of giving proof of payment I can go on and on and on everything just puts me back to square one so basically capitec is telling I can forget about my funds in my account and I can forget about my account wich I had for 16 years I use this account to receive all these small payments from my ppl and I've been doing my online companionship for about 3 years now it's my side income I don't see any wrong in that and I surely have no part in any *****ulent activities.  So if capitec want to keep that 500 frozen till they are done with their investigation then I won't refuse that but freezing all my funds and my account I use to receive my xtra little cash is not fair or am I being unreasonable? Please please can someone tell me what to do or how I can sort this issue alot sooner then please let me know.

2023/08/11 20:05,Piet B,Urgent Complaint: Unauthorized Withdrawals from My Account,"Dear Capitec Bank Customer Service,

My name is Piet Baard, a loyal and hardworking citizen who has encountered a distressing situation with Capitec Bank account. I have entrusted my life savings to Capitec Bank, believing in the bank's integrity and commitment to its clients. However, recent events have shattered my faith in the institution and left me devastated.

I received a phone call from an individual who claimed to be a Capitec Bank employee. The caller appeared legitimate as they possessed my personal information that only Capitec bank have had access to. The caller requested confirmation of certain details, citing security reasons at Capitec bank. Being cautious, I did not disclose any personal information during the call. To my utter shock, moments after ending the call, I received a text message notifying me that ALL my life savings have been withdrawn from my account.

Fearing the worst, I immediately rushed to the bank within an hour to report the incident. I hoped for swift resolution and assistance from the bank's side. However, to my dismay, I was met with a lack less response that left me speechless. How in the world could this be? The bank conveyed that they could not do anything to remedy the situation, leaving me and my family in a state of disbelief and emotional distress, not to mention broke and hopeless. From the same institution that I have been a loyal supporter and trusted client for years, How could this be? The bank’s true intentions revealed?

I took immediate action by filing an affidavit with the police and reaching out to both the bank and the ombudsman for assistance. Despite these efforts, I have yet to recover my ****** life’s savings (pension). What is even more alarming is that this incident occurred not just once, but twice, resulting in a total loss of 72,000 ZAR from my account over a period of three weeks. This money represents my life savings, and I was relying on it for me and my family’s future survival, including our partial retirement. I feel so disappointed and depressed, being rejected by Capitec and even making me feel that, what has happened with the ***** is MY OWN FAULT. How the heck can the same institution which I have entrusted with my faith and money, treat me like this. I feel so hopeless right now….

Considering these disheartening circumstances, I am questioning the bank's ethics and lack of response/ownership and wondering about the security measures in place at Capitec. Looking at this website and talking to my friends, it seems that I am not alone in this situation, as I have come across other clients facing similar issues. The bank's passive stance raises serious concern about internal involvement or potential hacking, leaving me and my family broke, hopeless and puzzled / anxious about the security of our hard-earned money or what is left of it…

I seek immediate answers, accountability, and most importantly, the return of my hard-earned money. I still believe that the bank has the ability to address and rectify this distressing / ******** matter swiftly if it simply choses to do so. Alternatively, I will be forced to leverage off of the ombudsman and my grandchildren’s network to take this to the highest level and reveal the true crime at the bank and internal involvement, but really all I want is my hard-earned money back.
I urge Capitec Bank to acknowledge the severity of his situation and take proactive measures to resolve this matter promptly. My life savings, security, and future are at stake, and I implore the bank to take swift action. 

All I want is for Capitec Bank to contact me and return my life savings of 72k ZAR.",1,1,Good day PietWe acknowledge receipt of your query and have assigned your matter to a designated official. You will receive further contact within the next business day.,2023-08-11 20:17:21

One, I did not receive any communication from Capitec about them closing off my account. I have a business and use this account for my Customers to make payments into my account so now my business has been affected and I am losing money each second that my account is closed. When I called Capitec they told me that there was a payment made to my account from an account that was flagged as a *****ulent account. I know nothing about this *****ulent account and now I am entangled into this web that I have no idea when it will be sorted out. I went to the police station and made an affidavit and sent it to the bank with relevant documents and they advised me that they will conduct an investigation and come back to me when they are done, my only worry is that now my business is on hold as my customers are unable to make payments to me so that means I can’t sell my products.

Thanks again to Dineo from Sam ntuli branch in Katlehong for such excellent cusomer service, however the other departments within capitec have the worst customer service.

This what happened: My colleague sent money into my account (R3500) and asked me to make a Takealot purchace for her. I didn't see a big deal. Only to find out the account she sent money from is linked to ***** activities. The consulant at Capitec said I should submit my certified ID and affidavit stating where the funds came from and I did. After a couple of days I went there to check the progress and they said they also need the sender's affidavit and certified ID, again i submitted them. 

Few days ago, i went to capitec again to find out what's happening and apparently they want another affidavit and I did. 

It's been two weeks now this issue has been dragging, apparently its been investigated. I cant access my funds as if I am a ******** even after all the documents provided. Why is this taking forever? Why am I treated like this is not a matter of urgency. I've been running up and down police station and capitec. My issue is still unresolved. What about my financial needs? Debit orders?

2023/08/09 13:24,Dean H,"49 days, over 30 emails, and counting, to open a business bank account with Capitec!","After a meeting on 21 June with relationship banker David Kutu my cousin emailed him to ask for confirmation of a list of requirements to open a business account were in fact correct. 

After no response I followed up 8 days later. David rep**** with ""We will be great to assist, when you ready please send through the required documents.""

He did not answer our question as to whether the list was correct or not. 

We emailed twice more over the next few days asking for confirmation, but none came from David.

I assumed that the list must be correct and then emailed all the documents to David. 
 
A week later after no response I tried to call David to get confirmation, spoke to 2 of his colleagues who said they would get David to call me, then I emailed him to let him know. This was now 12 July.

He responded to say ""the legal team"" had given the go ahead to open the account.

I asked how long will it take and he said ""3 to 7 working days"". He said he would contact me if anything was required. 

David asked for further information on the 15th July which I provided. Remember that we had on MANY occasions asked him what was required and he had not once told us.

9 days later I emailed David again to ask what is happening and the following day he replies that I did not send him everything he needed and stipulates what he needs that I had not sent.

I send those documents the same day again.

1 week later on 1 august I contact David again to find out what is happening. David responds a day later to say ""The Account has been submitted to accounts opening for processing. Will provide updates tomorrow before close of business, Thank you"".

He did not provide updates the following day as he had committed to. 

5 days later I I email him again to ask what is happening.

David replies to say that there are numerous issues with the documents we had provided. This is 41 days after we first asked him to confirm what documents and details were required!!! It is 33 days after we sent what we thought were the correct documents and details in light of David's failure to respond to our question. It is 26 days since ""legal team have gave me the go ahead"" for the account.

By this time I am hugely frustrated, I inform David I am on the verge of writing a complaint on Hello Peter, and ask why only now do we get this feedback and request for further information, and David says the account ""went for legal vetting"". No further information, and no further attempt to sort out the issue properly. 26 days earlier David had said ""legal team have gave me the go ahead""!!!!

I have today sent through more information requested, and also repeated an unanswered question to David about one of the issues that has apparently arisen.

The apparent lack of interest and responsibility during this process is astounding. I do not know what is happening in the background, but there is something very wrong here. It may be Capitec and how they do things with business banking, or it may just be the individual who dealt with us, but I certainly do not recommend anyone attempts to open a business account with Capitec!",1,1,Good day Dean We acknowledge receipt of your query and have assigned your matter to a designated official.

2023/08/09 11:34,De N,Did Capitec share my personal details and bank card with a third party?,"I indicated to Capitec in person in a branch that I am perfectly happy with an SMS notification from the bank in the event that I have a new bank card that needs to be picked up.

That's the good news. The terrible news is that there is a third party that somehow had obtained my personal information, whereby they offer me an option to get a bank card via a courier. I never signed up for this obvious security risk, nor would I ever. Yet this third party courier company seems to be in possession of both my personal information, and a personal bank card. 

Capitec or any other bank should not ever even consider such an option. One of the main reasons why I bank with Capitec is the biometric data that is collected when I am in a branch. This gives me as a customer the peace of mind that no changes can occur on my account without me being physically present and them having the fingerprint record to prove that indeed I were when changes were made. This is not a fool proof method and there have been breaches before, with for example credit card options not being honoured the way they were agreed to in person, but it is at least in principle a system that I trust and agree to. I do not agree with a third party obtaining my personal information at all, except in rare cases, and I do not ever wish to have a card mailed or couriered. That is not the level of service I have come to expect from Capitec, I am used to a higher standard.",1,1,Related:https:www.hellopeter.comccdcouriersreviewsdoyouhavemypersonalinformationandanunauthorizedbankcard,2023-08-09 11:55:10

The money was deducted from my account and was not returned back. I spoke to thir chat agent that told me it was a system discrepancy and that their support is handling it. He couldn't give me a turn around time to resolve the matter because he couldn't get hold of their support department. I further escalated the matter to their complaints department and all they could do is give me case number after case number. Tomorrow is Thursday and I need to render a service with the payment that is stuck with capitec business.

2023/08/08 15:34,Marc H,Bank won't release my name on one loan unless all 3 are paid?,"Not a happy camper with Capitec not only have the done me in the past with there retrenchment policy. In a nut shell I claimed they said I didn't and I had to prove that there branches sent the documents. So I have had to end up paying the loans in full. So okay I learnt an expensive lesson never trust anybody especially not your bank demand paper work for everything. Which gets us to the next part of the issue, according to them I have 3 loans which I am paying back monthly. They have handed me over to KGB their claims agency. I see that of the 3 loans one is down to R600 and I want to finish up the payment. So I only have 2 loans outstanding on itc instead of 3. I contact KGB and ask for the details for that loan so I can pay it off. I was told by kgb that this is not possible I need to pay all 3 in full to have anything removed. I don't understand if I pay the one loan in full I feel it should be removed from my listing. Furthermore I would think they would be more than glad to do that as I could now take the monthly payment from that loan and split up it up to pay the other 2 faster. Please help me understand the mentality in this type of business practice. Is it Capitec with these pathetic rules or kgb, I never receive calls back and after 5 years of paying the kgb have never received a statement.

2023/08/03 17:57,Peter,Capitec ***** - ZERO service and ZERO clue,"On 5 July my iPhone was ****** and hacked. When we saw the phone had been hacked we immediately called in to ***** to block all our families Capitec accounts. The person on ***** told us my one account had just been cleaned out and funds had gone Capitec to Capitec and immediately to Bidvest. An urgent ***** alert was sent to Bidvest to freeze the accounts. As that was happening another linked account was cleaned out also going Capitec to Capitec and immediately to Bidvest. Chaser sent to Bidvest agains to immediately freeze funds and accounts.

All that I was requested to do for Capitec ***** was done immediately (register a case with SAPS etc).......

Countless visits to the local branch, countless phone calls, immense irritation and the answer still remains ""no feedback received yet"".

2023/08/03 17:06,Jo-Anne Barkhuizen,Capitec Bank ***** department,"It’s with a heavy heart that I am writing this review about Capitec Bank, they have been a good bank for the last 2 years or so.

Two days ago, I was ****med out of money and I contacted Capitec Bank ***** department and told them my story and the account number that my money went to. They simply told me the account which my money went into there is no funds, so they cannot give me my money back and all they simply did they blocked the ****mer account and didn’t give me the information and was told to open.

It is sad that other banks actually go the extra mile and reimburse the client’s money but Capitec bank simply shrugs their shoulders and say sorry, I need to open a case at the police station, but how to I do that if I do not have the information of the person.

So, I started warning everyone about this ****mer and what they do and was told but Capitec should have reimbursed me.

It is with a heavy heart that I am moving my personal banking back to FNB, where I know at least they are on that level of assist the customer.

So please Capitec, help a loyal customer out.",1,1,"Good day JoAnne Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day.",2023-08-03 17:30:46
2023/08/03 17:03,Raun C,CAPITEC employs dishonest employees,"A year ago my credit score was affected because of an unpaid CAPITEC account. I never did and never will open an account with CAPITEC. I tried on numerous occasions to resolve this via phone but no joy. I've been to the Westwood branch and was told that a CAPITEC employee *****ulenty opened an account on my name. They said they it will be investigated and resolved. To date I've not heard anything from CAPITEC. Today I've been to the Chatsworth branch and inquired and still nothing has been done. I've spend over 40 minutes with the CAPITEC employee who couldn't assist me. He spent most of that time, on the phone, holding on for one of his colleagues to assist. It was a total waste of my time and money going into a CAPITEC branch for his manager couldn't assist either. 

I'm stuck with a bad credit score because of a useless bank that has ******* and *********** employees working for them.

I made a call to the help desk again to do a follow up, guess what, the lady on the other side of the line tells me again, to go look for the father of my kids and ask him for an affidavit and a copy of his certified ID which I already submitted, 
I want to know, how many times must I obtain affidavits and ID copies?? Everytime I try to do a follow up in dictated by capitec to bring yet another affidavit.  How many affidavits does capitec need from me for them to assist me as their client?? Are these documents even used by cqpitec to investigate or they just enjoy dictating to Mr and tell me to bring a different affidavit everytime I make a follow up since they won't even come back to me with the outcome of their investigation?? I don't feel assisted by capitec at all. At the end of the day, the money that was deposited  into my account was owed by the person to my kids, but where he got it, it's got nothing to do with me, and I can't monitor a grown man and ask him whenever he sends me money to feed my kids, where he got the money,

The lady that is assigned to my case is always unreachable and im told she'll get in touch but still nothing.
Bank with them at your own risk,coz they hardly ever care about you.

Dont even stop all 5 accounts just close them completely coz your failing your own clients.
I got proof that the client sent to me before I released the USDT.
After they got USDT they use capitec to cheat us and Capitec allows them.
Why would so many transactions happen and only 1 complain about that service unless they are the ****mers?
Even the *****ulent department is useless coz capitec clients go around with **** POPs to **** people and when you call they tell you to go to the branch and still need permission to access the account of the person that forged the amount.
Why dont you ask for permission before stopping accounts?

I’ve had a ***** case open with you guys since April 20 23 it is not 1 August I’ve done nothing this fall because I’ve been traveling overseas but this is beyond ridiculous. I opened up a case because I bought an item from a seller, who has an FNB account . Once the person received the money, they blocked me and I did not receive my goods. This is theft. I reported this to Capitec and they told me that they needed me to get a case number from the police which I did . I then called Capitec and emailed them with the case number as they requested and the information showing that the **** took place. Every single time I have called you people you keep telling me that you are waiting for the other bank, which is here FNB to get back to you ,how long does it take for you to do this ?  Clearly, it is not your money, so you are not worry to sort the problem out. I have had this bank account since 2020. I also do you have a business bank account if this is not resolved by the end of August 2023.

E-mail:***********
Mobile numher:**********
Account number:**********
This is after I reviewed my transactions on the app, I have an amount of R300 that went off from my account on the 26th of July 2023. This payment was not authorized because the bank did not send an OTP to authorize this and I also did not get any SmS notification to advise that R300 has gone off my account. 

I made a payment for zone fitness and I received a Authorization code to pre authorize that amount Capitec: Payment -R1219.00 from SAVINGS ACCOUNT; Ref ZONE FITNE NETCASH Town ZA; Avail R576.65; 26-Jul. Info **********, 

Capitec is letting ****mers to bypass the  security system, because had I received an OTP to Authorize the amount and had I received a SmS notification to report the purchase I would not be here. I believe that a financial institution should protect their clients by securing their banking.  My banking is not secured if I cannot trust the bank with R300.  I was at the Bellville Branch in Boston I was assisted by Zac and Kyle his assistance manager  they have very dry customer service skills I must say,, I seat on the chair for an hour. Zac could understand where I'm coming from as a client I'm assuming that most client are complaining about the same thing. Zac called his manager for. Me Kaylee, the only thing that he was good at it googling this service or product and treatede like a lying customer who authorized the payment and just cannot remember, he asked a lot of questions about where I was and told me  how this payment might gone out when I was paying, he could not careless about how I did not authorize it. 

Who ever that is going to deal with this query, must be aware that I'm a sober client and I want my money refunded as soon as possible. The reason that I want my money refunded is because the bank is failing or failed to protect my funds, because i did not get OTP nor notification that means the mastermind is inside the bank and knows very well how to pin point and bypass the system. I'm not going to allow the Bank to make me part of the victims lastly who ever thinks that I should change the card should have a waver fee ready because I'm not paying for no card, Capitec let the ****mers access my banking now I have to be the one that sufferes financial decrement.

I have done the new form and changed code to 410 as instructed but no adjustment has been made to allow the money to be paid to my account, 
More than a week ago I received an email stating that it was loaded and all funds will be paid to my account, my joy was short lived when I received another mail days later stating the exact same reference I already changed on new form must be updated to the same reference that I changed it to already.
The time difference makes it extremely difficult to phone and hang on the line for an unforseen time so I am literally on my last thread here to get assistance  for my money to be paid to my account so my debit orders can go off without incurring costs.

2023/07/31 09:01,Marius,POOR AND BAD SERVICE RECEIVE FROM CAPITEC,"""Without Prejudice"" 

Yes, it is me again. Just tell me how many times I must still email you guys to inform you what the problem is and why I am unhappy with Capitec. Once again, the story from myside and I also blame the consultant that informed me not to pay my outstanding Cell C account as I followed his advice. 

As per our telephone conversation yesterday, 27 July 2023. As mentioned, I am very unhappy with the level of service received from Capitec Bank. This is the first time I've ever received service like this. As you mentioned that I was preapproved, so what happened from being pre-approved and promises made to me when I was at the branch to be honored. 

I also copied the CEO on in this email, which I think is also not up to par as he is not taking calls or speaking to customers, as well as the banking ombudsman. 

As mentioned over the phone, you guys advertise everywhere that you must not apply for debt review and that you, as a customer, must first speak to your banker. So, as I am not a fan of debt review, I spoke to one of the consultants at the branch. The consultant then took all my documents, loaded it on the system and posted it. It was declined and he phoned the head office to enquire what the problem was.

That is how I found out about the adverse listing I had on my credit profile. He advised me that I need to get the adverse listing off and contact him again. So, I did that once the adverse listing was removed from my credit profile. He then did the application again; phoned head office and they advised him that I must get the adverse listing removed from my credit profile. I informed him numerous times about my cellphone account that was in arrears, which I also found out during this process. His exact words each and everytime was, nah Mr. Venter do not worry about the cellphone account, when the loan or credit is approved you can pay it in full. Well, as per advice from the consultant, I did just that. He knows better than me, so I thought. 

After a few months struggling to get my name removed on the credit profiles and receiving and building up endless contacts in the process, I informed him once again, as he instructed me to do so.

This is where the problems start. He then turned around and said to me that I must do the application on the app, which I did and the app gave me an error each and everytime. He then said that I must apply for vehicle finance at the banks and if the finance was approved the Capitec will approve me. Once again a FOOL I did as he instructed me. I got a decline as well and by doing this it influences my credit score severely. Do you think it is fair? No, I do not as this is making a huge impact on my credit profile, just to listen to the consultant. 

So, I imagine you can understand my frustration in this regard and that a SORRY Sir, do not cut it!!

Here is what I expect and want from Capitec. Due to this scenario, I want Capitec to approve a credit card or loan account in favour of me so that I can get my accounts paid in full and only have one please to pay each and every month. My salary is paid into my savings account on a monthly basis, so you are guaranteed to get the monthly installment each and every month. Also, I would like a dedicated consultant that I can phone when I have a problem or need to find something out, that can assist me and give me the correct advice. 

I want an answer back from you before 16:00 today, 28 July 2023, or I will take this matter further. Also, I do not want an apology, I want answers as I am entitled to it. 

If it was not for the bad advice from the consultant at the branch, then my cellphone account was paid in full, and it would not show as a huge amount outstanding on my credit profile. 

Also, do not inform me that the adverse listing still shows on my credit profile as it does not. I made sure of it. I have proof that it has been removed from Compuscan, Experian and Transunion.

I also forward an email to the CEO of Capitec, but I do not receive any feedback. I want answers and I want it before 12:00 today, or I will take further steps. Maybe contact all the mayor newspapers to inform all South Africans about the bad service once receive from the branch and heads office. 

I am beyond fed up now. Really.

2023/07/30 15:09,Sibongile M,Accidental Transfer,"I am very disappointed in Capitec and their customer service as well as the way in which the business does not protect it's customers!!! 

I accidentally sent money to an incorrect number on the capitec app, missed by 1 digit!!! The correct number is ********** and the incorrect one being  **********, which is clear human error. 

I then called the client centre and the first guy I spoke to advised that the money was still available on the recipients account and would be reversed back after having informed the guy that the money would be reversed back and that he would call us back to confirm. This call back did not take place and we called the centre again only to be told that it was all dependant on the recipients wether he gives consent or not. 

This person is in a different province!!! The information clearly shows where the money comes from and I fail to understand how Capitec protects it's clients, it seems like it's more in favour of this person who got money that was accidently sent to him. Capitec is clearly saying that you cannot make mistakes and if so you will not be assisted why then do we even have this damn app if it's not to assist!!! 3k is a lot of money to just give away!!!!!!!

To top it all of, I was charged a recall fee of R7 and received an sms saying that the request was successfully completed however there was no incident number provided. I called again to confirm what this meant and I was then told that this meant that the incident was closed, however not that it was successfully completed like wth is that even. I am beyond intrigued by this as I feel it to be an act of ***** from the bank. How should I recover R3000!!!

2023/07/29 19:41,Kelly L,"Capitec's slogan should be: ""Its Banking, Just WAY, WAY MORE DIFFICULT""","So I app**** for a loan on 26 June 2023, all looked good but the consultant told me that since my bank does not allow Debicheck mandates I could not be approved. So I needed to move my salary to Capitec, meaning I would have to wait an entire month to have my first salary dropped into this new account before I could apply again. This is exactly what I did, even though I needed the money urgently. You know, trusting the process.

Fast forward to 26 July 2023, I return to Capitec to re-do my loan application and I was declined due to an internal banking issue where their system linked my (very, very) old bank account with Capitec to the application, meaning I could not be approved. I then spent this entire week in and out of the branch trying to get this resolved, sent emails, the poor consultants and managers couldn't do anything, and my query is still not resolved. They basically gave up and who can blame them when they have absolutely no support in getting internal system issues resolved? There is just ZERO urgency.  

It's cool, I'll try somewhere else, but I am angry because I did everything they told me to do and moved my salary to this bank just to be treated like this. I am very very unhappy and I wish I never walked into that bank. During all of this, I did not want to and was also advised not to try another bank so that I can have my hard credit queries low, but now looking at Clearscore I have like 4+ unnecessary hard credit queries that have been done by Capitec over this unfortunate period that will surely impact my score. And after all that, still no assistance, no matter how many times the issue was escalated. 

Thanks a lot Capitec for wasting my time, and adding a whole lot more stress to an already super stressful situation that I am in. Great job. Rest assured that I'll be moving my salary and closing this account as soon as humanly possible.",1,1,"Good day Kelly Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/29 18:08,Itumeleng K,Horrible service,"I'm awaiting my salary from abroad and it came through Capitec for the first time. Worst nightmare ever, I spoke to the person called Zikhona on the 27th July which was the day my salary was already in Capitec's account. I asked her if she could please check what is causing the delay as that should have been released already..she told me there was nothing needed as international payments take 3 to working days I told her I know mine takes three and she still insisted that it takes up to seven days
I asked her if she was not going to check if I need to do anything on my end and she continues to be rude and unhelpful, she then asked for my ID number as if she was talking to a 2 year old..I them told her to put me through to someone who is willing to help as I didn't like her attitude. She gladly sent me back to the queue and I got through to Vinchanzo Mostert who was friendly, professional,knowledgeable and patient with me. He explained the procedure to me end ensured that I received the email before he put me through to the the forexSI department. I didn't get any joy there because I needed to get someone to guide me through the form but I have up while holding on for that department. I then went to the Reade route branch where Dimpho had to run around with the form trying to get people for assist is with having the forms filled in since we were not getting through to ForexSI by phone. We eventually gave up and sent the forms through to them and they said they want them filled in and sent which shows that the person did not open the attachments. 

We received the incident numbers and that's it. 
I had to go to the Protea Glen branch for assistance this morning yet they also didn't win as the dpt works Monday to Friday till 5 pm. 

I do not have my salary as we speak and I have debit orders that are busy bouncing from my other back account because I didn't transfer the amount on time...I hope I will not inccure any charges because Capitec is withholding my salary.

My colleagues also experienced such an experience as well and this is really ridiculous and I also have responsibilities with that salary. 

I'm also going to close this accra d go back to the other back as they approve such on the App and the process and service is up to standards.

2023/07/29 15:58,Bill T,Capitec IT hiccup wreaks havoc with credit card and loan payments around 15 July 2023,"Complaint sent to ombudsman on 29 Jul, 2023 with two zip files (that were also sent to Willowbridge Capitec branch)
Reference Id-20M4LPNE

Capitec had an IT hiccup on or around 15 Jul 2023.

That was the day my credit card payment was due.

My account is configured to pay the entire amount automatically from my savings account **********)

I had even received an SMS from Capitec when the previous period closed informing me the full amount of R29813.82 would be collected on 15 Jul. The Jun credit card statement also said as much.

However, due the IT hiccup, only the minimum payment of R1490.69 was debited.

I didn't realise this for a couple days because I wondered why I still had so much money in my savings account.

On 18 Jul, I emailed *********** and got a swift reply with reference #**********55 with the following text:
""Our IT team has advised that an error has occurred regarding the credit card debit order collections, however, they are working on resolving the matter as soon as possible.

Kindly allow for sufficient funds in your main account for the time being, alternatively, you may make a manual payment via the App.

Please accept our apologies for this inconvenience.

Thank you for allowing us to attend to your query. Feel free to contact us in future.""

I thought they would sort it out. 

But a few days later, on 21 Jul, I received the Jul credit card statement and to my horror, saw that not only had they not taken off the rest of the automatic payment as per normal, they also charged me R782.62 interest! 

Since I always pay off each month's credit card amount in full, I don't ever pay any interest at all.

Then, firstly I paid the difference of R28323.13; and secondly rep**** to the bank's apology email several times without response. 

Then I tried to follow up with Capitec's WhatsApp chat to no avail. I asked to have the issue escalated to a supervisor and no one contact me via phone, WhatsApp or email.

So today, 29 Jul, I went in to the Willowbridge branch. They tried to help but their credit card people (on phone) refused to deal with it, as they cannot do so on weekends? As I was listening, I was baffled that the credit card support could not comprehend what had happened even though she acknowledged knowing of the IT errors; and further, heard from the branch support that this happened to many people with their credit card payments, and also for loan payments, there were double debits, and all kinds of other errors around 15 Jul.


Firstly, I would like a) the interest refunded/credited, b) reassurance that I won't be charged any interest moving forward, and c) that automatic monthly payment in full will return to normal.

Secondly, I would like to ask that the ombudsman make (a), (b) and (c) happen for *every Capitec client that was affected*. Judging by the response from Capitec customer support by phone, email and WhatsApp, that's not the case and Capitec stands to make potentially millions of rands from *their* mistake from unsuspecting customers and/or customers that don't take the time to complain because of its apparent futility. 

Lastly, if this really is part of their business model, I would like advice on how to pursue a class action suit against the bank for this predatory and bullying behaviour.",3,1,Good day Bill We acknowledge receipt of your query and have assigned your matter to a designated official.

2023/07/29 13:56,Phuti M,Capitec bank is not a reliable bank to use they don't care of us as their customers even if you bank with them they don't listen to you when you say you have an unauthorized transaction in your account. Iam not the first one on the same day my colleague l,I wrote a complain on the 15th July about a transaction that I had on the 14th July from Hotel stay Benoni travel agent  they said to me they have a promotion of a once off payment of R399 but they took R3990 that we never agreed about then I went to capitec bank to lodge a dispute I was told that I am the one who agreed with the transaction. I tried to talk to the capitec Agent as I was given a phone but she argued that they cannot reverse that online transaction. I complained to hello Peter and I was promised that capitec will contact me I was not contacted at all. On the 22nd of July the other transaction went on again of R3990 and it was written Hotel stay Durban this time to my surprise I was having only R623 in my bank account but the o line payment was R3990 I then went to work and asked Togo to the bank and I was told the transaction went through on the 19th July when I was still having some funds but I could not understand as I got the massage on the 22nd July around 1:28Am. As shocked as I was told they are doing investigations I will get my money back on Monday but they will still continue with investigations I asked how did the transaction go on as I have changed the card on the 14th and paid a R70 fee for a new card that is when I was told the capitec Agent I spoke to over a phone did not enroll my card so I asked who's problem is that now they said is theirs as a bank I was promised a refund of the otherbank  card and they took R70 again for another bank card. I was never contacted by capitec nor got any refund Monday and Tuesday  then I made a contact the Hotel stay Agent by what's up then they send me proof to tell capitec to reverse the amount that went through on the 14th as they are unable to reverse it. On Tuesday around my lunch time I went to capitec to give them that proof to make a reversal and also asked about the investigations as I was never contacted or got a refund they said the investigations might take 7 working days but they promised to refund the first transaction of the 14th July within 4 hours I then went back to work to my surprise at around 4pm when I was about to knock off I  got an sms of a refund of R3990 but shocked as the balance is now R623 that went missing on the 22nd.i tried to withdraw and swipe but the money could not go through for both and I got an sms that my investigation is cIosed then I was phoned by the capitec consultant who was helping me to make that refund and she was as shock as I am to hear that and she told me to come to the bank on Thursday I knocked off at 13h00 and went to capitec bank they tried to phone the Agent who was  busy with my Investigation there was no answer when they email her she said she will come back to us she is busy with another call I waited for about an hour then they said the R3990 for the transaction on the 14th is no longer hanging on the like it was not processed but now it was processed. they told me they will contact me till today....,1,1,"Good day Phuti Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

The loan payment was transferred immediately thereafter. But my credit card still haven't been paid.

2023/07/26 11:14,Zintle L,Capitec bank payment reversal service is useless,"If you are using Capitec bank and you unwittingly send your money to ****mers,you are in trouble.Unfortunately there's nothing Capitec bank can do to help you despite their claim that they have a payment reversal service.I fell for this lie and requested this service from Capitec bank 3 weeks ago after realizing that I had sent R2000 to ****mers. The agent on the line assured me that they will assist me but the service will cost me R160. Three weeks passed without any feedback from Capitec. I finally decided to email them to request feedback, their response was that I should contact the person I sent the money to as they have failed to get his permission to get my money back. So I contacted Capitec bank's customer care to seek clarification as I had not been made aware that all they can do is ask the ****mers nicely to pay my money back. The customer care agent did a great job at making me feel dumb as she kept repeating that it was not Capitec bank who told me to send my money to ****mers. My complaint was that I cannot believe they are charging customers a R160 and providing basically nothing. I feel like I've been ****med twice , by the ****mers and by Capitec bank for claiming that they can help me if I just pay the fee. They failed to inform me that all they can do is have a conversation with the ****mer and ask them to give my money back, anyone with a brain can guess the outcome of that conversation,that's not a service I would pay even one cent of my money for.

2023/07/25 15:03,Yolandi T,Urgent Complaint: Unacceptable Treatment and Negligence by Capitec Bank,"Dear Hello Peter,

I am writing to express my deep frustration and disappointment with the abysmal service I recently experienced at Capitec Bank. As a longstanding customer, I have always trusted that my funds would be safe and secure with the bank. However, a recent incident has left me questioning their commitment to protecting their clients from *****ulent activities.

Below is a chronicle of the distressing events that occurred:

1. On the early morning of Saturday, 22 July 2023, at approximately 1:30 AM, I received push notifications on my cellphone, alerting me to unauthorized transactions from my bank account. These transactions were made during the night while I was asleep and completely unaware.

2. Seeking immediate assistance, I rushed to the Capitec Bank branch at Vaal Mall, Vanderbijlpark, on the same Saturday morning. There, I was attended to by a bank representative named Flora.

3. Flora, to her credit, took the matter seriously and promptly contacted the Capitec ***** Department to investigate the unauthorized transactions. The ***** Department confirmed that tap card payments transactions were made at unusual times and outside of regular business hours.

4. Flora assured me that she would discuss the matter with the Branch Manager and promised to call me back on Monday, 24 July 2023, with an update. Sadly, I did not receive any communication from her, which left me deeply concerned and anxious about the status of my account.

5. Taking matters into my own hands, I decided to contact the bank myself on Monday afternoon to speak directly with the Branch Manager. Shockingly, I was informed that the case had already been closed, and I was simply advised to go to the SAPS (South African Police Service) and open a case there. This response was completely unacceptable, as I firmly believe that the bank has a responsibility to safeguard its clients' funds from *****ulent activities.

6. Expressing my dissatisfaction with the Branch Manager's response, I was met with a shocking lack of empathy and professionalism. He dismissively remarked, ""Must I paint you a picture,"" which was both condescending and unprofessional. Please note that I have recorded this call as evidence, and it is available upon request.

7. Determined to seek a resolution, I visited the bank in person, insisting on speaking to the Branch Manager once again. During this interaction, the manager made an unwarranted and offensive assumption that I might have given my card to someone else, which is a ridiculous and baseless accusation. I want to emphasize that I am a responsible individual and take the security of my finances very seriously. Regrettably, my concerns were met with the same sarcastic response, indicating a severe lack of regard for the seriousness of the situation. When I mentioned escalating the matter to the bank's ombudsman, his retort was, ""please do so,"" further demonstrating his lack of concern for my predicament.

The treatment I received from Capitec Bank throughout this distressing ordeal is utterly unacceptable. As a loyal customer, I expected the bank to prioritize my security and demonstrate a commitment to assisting me during times of crisis. Instead, I was met with indifference, dismissiveness, and negligence, which only added to the stress and anxiety caused by this *****ulent incident.

I urgently request that Capitec Bank takes immediate action to thoroughly investigate the unauthorized transactions and take full responsibility for the security of their clients' accounts. Furthermore, I expect prompt reimbur*****t of the funds that were *****ulently taken from my account.

By sharing my harrowing experience on this platform, I sincerely hope that Capitec Bank will take my complaint seriously and address the issues raised with utmost urgency. As a customer, I believe I deserve to be treated with respect, empathy, and professionalism, especially in times of distress.

I eagerly await a swift and comprehensive response from Capitec Bank and trust that appropriate measures will be taken to rectify this situation.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/25 13:29,Marius,Very Bad and Poor Service Received!,"""Without Prejudice""

Good Day,

I would like to lay a formal complaint and I want the CEO himself to answer me in this regard. I am now fed-up with the level of service I receive from Capitec Bank, and I think there can be more clients who feel the same as me and are just too afraid to say anything about it. 

My first level of frustration and very very poor service: began in March/April when I visited the bank to enquire about a loan or a credit card, as because you advertise everywhere, before you do a debt review or anything else, speak to us, we will assist you.

So, I did see a banker. He advised me that I need to get an account from my name, which was an adverse listing, then I come back again, and we try for a personal loan to get my cell phone account paid in full as it is not a problem with the bank to obtain a personal loan or credit card.

So, I paid the adverse listing in full, and I struggled for around 2 months to get it cleared from my name on the credit bureaus. That was removed and I contacted the branch again and forward all my details. In this period, I wanted to buy a motor vehicle and wanted to take out a personal loan in order to buy the vehicle cash.  

After countless time waiting and phoning, I eventually got hold of the banker. Then, it seems to me, he did not want to do anything anymore to assist me and just said to me that I must do everything on the app. So, explain to me this: Why do you advertise that you must speak to a banker just for the banker to turn around and inform you you must do everything on the app.

Needless to say, the app was not updated as yet and come to think of it, it is my cell phone account that is preventing this. 

Second level of frustration and very very poor service: 


I am busy with a Charity Run for Waterberg Wildlife Sanctuary. I received a payment from Botswana. After countless weeks of trying to phone, email the forex team, to no avail. After I logged a complaint on Hello Peter, PS: This email will be posted on HELLOPETER again so that everyone can see the bad service one receives from Capitec. Then this morning, I received phone calls, oh no, sorry sir the payment was reversed as the beneficiary was not right, ****TY ATTITUDE, BAD SERVICE ONCE AGAIN. I was also asked if I declared it, why must I declare funds coming into my account?? It is from a neighboring country, BOTSWANA, not the USA or the UE.

Really, guys this is not on!!!!!!!!!! If you would like me as a customer, then you must come to the party. I will ask the person to deposit the amount to me again and get it cleared this time. I am also doing work for companies in Africa so if they pay me, must I declare that as well?? I do not have time for this ****. 

Like I previously stated, I wanted to open a business account with Capitec, but to the level of service I receive and that is on my personal account, then I am not doing so. I would rather go to Absa, FNB or Standard Bank.

I also would like to receive better service and actually get someone from Capitec that actually knows what they do to contact me via email as I cannot receive phone calls during working hours, I am in meetings the whole day every day. 

I would like to get a consolidation loan, to pay my cell phone account and other accounts in full as I urgently need to buy myself a new vehicle otherwise, I am without an income.

Can Capitec do that???? Can Capitec give a client like me a better service??? I am many many years a client of Capitec and I think this level of service is really not what is supposed to be.

I am done with branches. Either the CEO or a Manager contact me back and assist me with all my enquiries or I am closing my account and moving to another bank. I also have a great piece of mind to publish an article in all the major newspapers so that everyone can see what kind of service to expect from Capitec Bank.

Your URGENT reply awaits.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day. Kind regards Capitec Bank",2023-07-25 16:46:56

For them, it's more money each time you use a branch to reactivate but they will hide it behind the security reason/inactivity. Today I had to endure their horrible queues just so I can do an intra-account transfer which could have been avoided had they not altered my preferences without my CONSENT.

2023/07/25 12:48,Judy M,Closed Account,"I have been playing stockvel with a number of people on WhatsApp, I received funds from the stockvel group I'm in. And at a later stage I realized that my account has been stopped. I went into the bank to query what's going on and I was then informed that my account was used for *****. According to the bank I had received funds of R1025. 00 which was linked to some *****ulent activities. The person who sent me the R1025 was part of the stockvel group. I do not know who exactly paid me but I was told to make an affidavit explaining what took place. I did as requested and they said there wasn't enough information on the affidavit. I then went to make another one explaining in detail. Today I went to the bank to find out what's going on but sadly I was informed that my account has been stopped and will not be reopened. I have no involvement in the ***** they reffering too and I am even willing to go as far as they want to prove that I am not involved. I'm really not happy with the service I received. I'm willing to prove my innocents however Capitec is adamant on the fact that they will not open my account. I get paid through Capitec and the cut off date has passed for me to change banks so that I could get paid when my pay day arrives which is on the 31st. They told me to open an account with another bank but how will I get paid if the cut off date for change of banks is closed? How will I feed my family if I do not get paid? My expenses will be paid with what money if I do not have an account?

2023/07/24 17:54,RENTHIA B,Bad experience,"hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my extreme frustration and disappointment with the services provided by Capitec Bank, particularly regarding the unresolved issue of my blocked account.

My name is Renthia Roslyn, and I have been a loyal customer of Capitec Bank for 6 years . Unfortunately, I have encountered a distressing problem that has been ongoing for more than three months, and despite numerous attempts to rectify the situation, my account remains blocked, leaving me with limited access to my funds and facing significant inconvenience.

The issue began on May 27, when I suddenly found myself unable to access my account through both online banking and the bank's mobile application. Alarmed by this unexpected blockade, I immediately contacted the customer support team to seek resolution. However, since then, I have been caught in a never-ending loop of phone calls, emails, and visits to my local branch, without receiving any concrete solution to the problem.

During this time, I have been subjected to extended wait times on the phone, transferred between departments multiple times, and have had to recount my issue to various representatives who seem to lack any real knowledge of the matter. Each time I am assured that my account will be unblocked soon, but to my dismay, there has been no progress to date.

As a result of this prolonged account blockage, I have faced severe financial strain and inconvenience. I have been unable to make crucial payments, access my funds for necessary expenses, and even missed out on potential investment opportunities, all of which have had a significant impact on my financial stability and personal life.

I understand that every organization may encounter challenges from time to time, but I firmly believe that as a valued customer, I deserve timely and effective assistance in resolving this matter. I have always upheld my responsibilities as an account holder, and I expect the same level of dedication from Capitec Bank to ensure the seamless functioning of its services.

Therefore, I kindly request an immediate investigation into the cause of my account blockage and a swift resolution to this matter. Furthermore, I seek a detailed explanation for the extensive delay in addressing my complaint, as well as assurances that such mishaps will not occur in the future.

If my account is not unblocked and the issue remains unresolved within the next  10 business days, from the date of this letter, I will be compelled to consider other avenues, including escalating this matter to relevant banking regulatory authorities and seeking legal assistance to protect my rights as a customer.

I sincerely hope that this matter can be resolved amicably and without further delay. I look forward to a prompt response from Capitec Bank and a satisfactory resolution to my complaint.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Renthia",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only RENTHIA B can view this message.",2023-07-24 18:45:54

On the 06/07/2023 I took a loan with Capitec Bank Diepkloof Square then the consultant noticed that I have another loan with African Bank then he gave me on option to consolidate the loan with African Bank so I can have one instalment. I agreed and didn’t mind that, then the consultant took the settlement amount from the credit bureau to settle my loan with African bank. Today I contact African Bank for the pay up letter all to find that I owe R4900, I was shocked and explained my story. They told me that the consultant that was assisting me from Capitec was supposed to call African Bank to get the correct settlement amount as the credit bureau system doesn’t give the account amount. I quickly went to Capitec bank to tell them the story and they didn’t want to account for their mistake instead they told me to go make payments arrangements with African bank for the mistake that was done from their end. Now I must settle the amount of money which could have been avoided when we were consolidating the loan amount. This was really hush and no empathy or sense of humour was taken into consideration as I app**** for a loan with them because I dont have money, now they put me into any debt which was supposed t be avoided; I dont know why we blacks like to treat each other so bad because I’m quite sure if it was a white person they were going to settle that amount.

On the 23rd July 2023 my 69 year old father went to village square mall Randfontein to get assistance so that He could send me money. When He got there a gentleman that works at the brunch assisted him with the transaction. The money was in his fixed savings account so first the guy assisted him with transferring it to his day to day account and was meant to do a payment into my account but He suddenly told my Dad there was no money, so now there’s a case of where the money went? I had to drive to the brunch after they traumatized my dad accusing him of taking the money meanwhile the assistant was there and is aware that my father didn’t withdraw it. Your staff insisted that my father must search for the money on him and found nothing but the person that was assisting him who might have taken the money was not searched. I went there today to try to understand what happened with the money I was told an ATM dispute would be logged. What shocks me is the lack of accountability, suddenly I was told that it is not the staff’s responsibility to assist more like a favor they do for their customers.

All lies. I spoke to your Head Office this morning and not one of those idiots even bothered to make any effort or even make a note on her account of the complaint or the issue at hand.

I've been a Capitec client for many years, but have to drop my head in shame.

I work internationally and have tried to send my family money. I've followed all the instructions before the money was sent filled in all their forms.

Clearly there is a problem somewhere because I've sent the money on the 7th and it still hasn't reached my family. I've sent 6 emails to their Forex department. 2 to their customer service. Explaining my situation giving proof of the transaction. And that I am working on a crew ship so I don't have access to a phone in the the middle of the sea. Guess what. Customer service response was to wait 10 days and then try and call. There is clearly a problem. So would it have hurt anymore to investigate and tell me what's wrong that we can solve it... Or does customer service not get covered by Capitec 's portfolio... 

No care in the world. Must say it's been an upgrade from no responses from Forex.

Any suggestions on what to do and perhaps suggestions on a bank we can use that will actually care about customer service and working with our families accounts.",1,1,"Good day MarcelThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

On the 5th of July Capitec froze my account without even notifying me know. I went to find out as I couldn't transaction on my account. They told me that there were funds that they suspect I received *****ulently. This also affected my Nedbank account which is also frozen as Capitec advised them to. I did everything Capitec bank requested. They then lifted the hold on my accounts. Now they are giving a run around, as are now suppose to advise Nedbank again to lift the hold on my account since they are the ones that advise the to hold my account from the onset. Now they are playing hide and seek. This is the most terrible service I have ever received as I now unable to transact on my accounts from Nedbank. It was easy for the to advise Nedbank to put my accounts on hold and now it's difficult for the to advise Nedbank to lift the hold on my account. Now they make me run around.

I came very late just before they closed I thought they were going to turn me away however Sbo gave me a warm friendly smile and assured me that I am very important, so he started the process of applying for credit card after he has done everything the power went off and he has to start all over again and he did but again the system gave him an error so he had to start the process all over again and he did, but again when we have done everything and only have to punch in the PIN system error occurred again this happened numerous times then he had to call the head office and he did call them after being on the call for more than 12 minutes he started the process all over again and finally everything went well.

When we go to the banks we sign documents and take huge interest rates without even realising it. I may not understand the interest rates but what I can tell you is that I have been paying R2,248 for 24 months and when I calculate that its R53,952. I took R70,000 loan and after 24 months I have paid the bank in total R53,952 but only R10,000 has been paid on that debt and I still owe R60,359.69

I am still left with 4 years 
Meaning by the time I finish off my debt I would have already paid Capitec Bank R161,856

Now when I check the difference from the loan I took Capitec Bank will gain R91,856

This is heart breaking as we are struggling already and trying to make ends meet and you get ********** by Capitec Bank.

I was told that the disputed was open and the money will be reserved back on my account after 24hours. I want for 2days without any comminication. Even today the money isn't yet back to my account. Then I decided to ask again today using WhatsApp platform what's going on with my case. I was chatting with the lady called Zanele Reference number is **********19. She told me that I need to wait for 8days which I agree to give bank enough time to investigate the case. I was surprised to receive a message says "" Capitec: Mr MUTSWANA, your Debit MasterCard was stopped successfully. Order a new card on your Capitec App or simply visit your nearest branch for a replacement. Info: **********"" But I never give her instructions to closed my card. I didn't even received any approval notification on my capitec app to approved to allow her to closed my card. I am sitting here today and I want to used my card today I was told that my card is blocked without my permission. She told me that I need to go the branch to get a new card which I will pay R70 for the things that I didn't even give her permission to closed my card. I am staying away from Capitec branch now I can't used my card because Zanele decided to closed my card without my permission.

I need to know if this how Capitec Bank do things access our account without our permission as customer. I even ask her to send me that policy that allow capitec bank to closed customer card without customer permission. I thought maybe this bank it's better than other banks

2023/07/21 08:48,Cindy G,Capitec Banking fails to assist their senior citizens as clients!!! Disappointing and shocking,"Capitec Bank does not take the senior elderly citizens or their clients into condiseration.
My 93 year grandmother had a hip and femur operation, therefore she is bedridden and unable to walk. Her banking card has expired. Us as a family has exhausted all our options in order to retain her pension for June 2023. We have contacted capitec on numerous occasions, and they cannot assist us. They insist that my granny the client come in to the bank to sign a form band provide her signature. We cannot take her with a stretcher into the bank which means we will need to get a private ambulance which will cost thousands of rands. Is there really no other option to assist this old lady that so desperately needs her money as she needs food and diapers and medication. Why can the branch manager not even con put to show his or her face born try to resolve this problem. The ward councilor along with a sassa associate has exhausted all their options in attempting to help her. But they say that they can't come out to her. So the councilor managed to change her bank to First National Bank in order for her to receive July's payment. Capitec is the only bank that can not come out to their senior citizens to assist. Fnb came out and actively assisted her and created a new bank account for her. But capitec is withholding her money due to a signature and a fingerprint. Moving my grandmother just to get to a bank will be the cause of her death. I am extremely disappointed in capitec that they would not go the extra mile for their clients, but are very quick to cold call to open new accounts and to apply for loans. Surely, somehow, someone at a higher level of authority can attend to this matter as it is a matter of dire urgency. How can this be solved? WHO CAN HELP? MY 93 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER URGENTLY NEEDS ASSISTANCE AND CAPITEC IS NOT HELPING HER AT ALL. It is very disheartening and this is going to happen to the next old person. We told the bank that she was in hospital, they simply refused to take that into consideration. Where are the higher authorities bof this bank and are there any contact details so that we as a family can escalate this?

2023/07/20 16:41,Maureen,ONGOING CAPITEC SAGA - CUSTOMER CARE IS NON-EXISTENT IF *****STERS HAVE ****** YOUR MONEY,"R98,100 was taken our of my Capitec account on 26 May 2023 by someone who was already in my account.
I have followed Capitec's procedure relating to ***** and I have written 2 previous Hello Peter complaints on 7 and 11 July.  Capitec said that they would have someone contact me.  They did - ONCE!   The agent was not very helpful and despite me asking her to call back in 10 minutes, I'm still waiting after 12 days.
I have received an sms message on 17 July stating 'Kindly be advise that we are still busy investigating your complaint.  We will contact you as soon as feedback is available'.
The money was taken on 26 May.  On 27 May we provided sworn statements and a SAPS case number to Capitec, White River.  They should have had these by Monday 29 May.  It has thus taken them over seven weeks and they still haven't concluded the investigation.

2023/07/20 13:01,Tembi J,Capitec Forex department is a nightmare,"Dear Hello Peter Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your intervention in a distressing matter I have been experiencing with the Forex Department at Capitec Bank, as well as the numerous unhelpful interactions I have had with the Capitec client care team regarding the delay in receiving a deposited sum in my account.

On the 5th of July, 2023, I was expecting a significant amount of money to be deposited into my Capitec account from Lesotho. Unfortunately, despite the passage of time, this deposit has not reflected in my account until today. This issue has caused significant frustration and inconvenience for me.

Despite my unwavering efforts to resolve this matter, I have hit a dead end. I have approached the Capitec client care team multiple times, relaying the urgency and importance of the situation. Regrettably, they have proven to be utterly useless and unresponsive, even though they admit they are aware of the problem.

It is apparent that the Forex Department at Capitec Bank is a detriment to their customers, as they have mishandled or failed to process my deposit accurately, leading to this persistent issue. I have exhausted all possible avenues in resolving this matter internally, leaving me with no other choice but to seek the assistance of Hello Peter.

I humbly request your urgent intervention to help me locate and retrieve my deposited funds from Capitec Bank. I believe that your expertise and influence can bring attention to this matter, pushing Capitec Bank to take immediate action and rectify the situation promptly.

I kindly request the following actions to be taken on my behalf:

Investigate the delay in reflecting the deposited money in my Capitec account.
Facilitate communication between Capitec Bank's Forex Department and me to expedite the resolution process.
Advocate on my behalf to ensure that Capitec Bank acknowledges and rectifies their mishandling of this matter.
Prompt frequent updates on the progress made towards resolving the issue until the matter is finally resolved.
I sincerely appreciate your understanding and willingness to assist in this matter. I trust that Hello Peter's intervention will bring much-needed attention and resolution to my predicament. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you require any further information or clarification.

Regards",1,1,"Good day Tembi Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day.",2023-07-20 14:00:47

If the other bank that sent the money is investigating the sender as they suspect *****ulent activity, why are the stopping my capitec account when I am a recipient, worse part of it with no communication with their client?
I have an insurance with capitec, I have debits going through the capitec account, so now that they stopped my account how are they going to debit for those insurance I have with them?

It is so amazing that whenever it`s me who is performing the transaction on my account I would receive the bank notification to approve the transaction or even an otp but when they are stilling our hard earns money nothing.

2023/07/18 13:13,Lizaan T,DO NOT go to them with foreign anything,"I work for an international company and have always received foreign income. When opening my bank account I had to fill in a form stating exactly that and was promised I would never run into issues releasing my money. Well that is not the case. Every pay day is a struggle just to get my money. Last month we received an email to say we needed to fill in a standing instruction form. I tried for almost 2 weeks to get hold of the forex department to get assistance with the form. Eventually went to the branch to get help. Submitted the form on the 29th of June. I have since sent 14 emails - no response. Numerous phone calls and I get put on hold so long my airtime runs out each time. - No assistance. Now today I get an email saying they can't release my money because there is no instruction form and I need to verify my details etc. Which I did. Still no response from them and no money in my account. I am livid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! more than a month of struggling with the form and no help and now I need to struggle even further just to get my money released and they offer no help, no response and no answer. I even laid two complaints about the zero help with the form and all they say is sorry ma'am we have escalated your query. Hopefully now I will get a response and my money released so I can move to another bank because after this I'll never want to deal with capitec again.",1,1,"Good day LizaanThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

She finally called and told me that the amount taken from my credit facility account is interest, insurance and disabily. She didn't want to entertain my question of how does these fees get to be deducted twice in one month from different accounts. She then told me I was rude and put the phone on mute while I was asking questions... when I heard it was dead quiet on her side I said hello, she unmuted me and said I'm here.... the audacity of that lady... she then started gaslighting me instead of answering my question telling me that I dont want to listen to her. She then said that ""they"" told her the funds were interest and disability and she's telling me what she's told. I thought this was a person that was going to investigate not a third person to be told something she can't back up. I then told her I'll hang up, she can call me as soon as she's investigated and is willing to speak to me.

The amount transferred was R7600.00 to be exact. I used the self service station because I find that more convenient, I just was not aware on how to change the system to get an immediate print out of the transaction. I then asked for the assistance and the back office was contacted to arrange for the POP to be sent to me. 
My email was confirmed, I waited for the entire weekend for the email to no avail, I was then pressured to go the branch to attain the POP so the my purchase could be released. To my my dismay, I was told that the request is still pending at the back office and that it usually takes 48 hours for mere POP to be sent to me in regards to my account in which I have granted permission for because this urgent. 

I  am still waiting for the so-called back office to send to me what I need to get my purchase. I was not online however the incompetence of Capitec and its tedious systems have made my purchase unbearable. 

1. The Self Service desk is easy however getting a print out and you have never been trained well enough on the machine makes it even more harder.
2. Why would the so-called back office agree to sending the POP yet it takes an arrangement from pillar too post to get a simple document of a transactions I made.

2023/07/17 11:28,Lynnette,Not much for professionalism,"I am ashamed to be a Capitec client.
With a credit good standing and more than enough funds, Capitec decides to decline my credit card (that I need to improve my credit)
No one bothers to contact me to discuss or reconsider.
Call centre agent - Palesa - decides to put the phone down in my ear when I demanded to speak to the manager or someone in charge of the applications.
I must contact experian as they work on my AFFORDABILITY. 
I must've been born under a rock as Experian sent me a credit report with a great credit score.
None the less, useless Capitec, I was approved by another MAJOR bank who also uses Experian and my credit card will be delivered within the next 48 hours.
I will be closing all my accounts with your unprofessional and rude bank!",1,1,"Good day LynnetteThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/16 12:33,Sanelisiwe Z,****mers of Bank,I logged a review here regarding my Compliant about two ago. Regarding my account being debited R 2450 and R 608 respective by loan companies l knew nothing about. I went to a Capitec Branch in Clearwater Jhb and l was turned due not having my ID card at the time. This was huge surprise to as Capitec is known for using fingerprint technology besides lD verification of a client. So went back to the next day with my lD and the consultant deal with my query told me that l will receive an incident number of the Case which l never received even today. After my second review in this platform they called during the call l was advised that when they up my ID number on their system they don't pick up any information that indicates that l am one of thier clients. After a long conversation of how long l had my account the consultant said they are investigating the matter with out giving me any time frame for the investigation to be concluded. About 5 to 6 later l got another call informing me that they are closing my case cause it looks like it has been resolved. My question was how can it be resolved with me receiving my hard earned money back shares e then they are continuing with investigation. It's been a week since her no feedback what so ever. I would like advice after that bad customer service l received l am considering taking the matter up to the FAIS because the way you guys are delaying this matter it looks like my money was taken by one of your consultants this why you are protecting them. I need feedback before l take further damaging actions.,1,1,"Good day Sanelisiwe Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/16 12:21,Vivian,Capitec gone backwards,"I am beyond disgusted and irritated. It's been almost 4 months since we requested a business account. We we contacted and filled in all the paperwork, did everything on our side. And then everything went quiet. We were never informed that the account had been opened... no communication whatsoever. We started receiving a statement for an account we never knew existed and was unable to even open the statement because we did not know the password. We had to go back to the bank where we were informed that we owe money on the account but we cannot pay it because the account is not active and that there must have been miscommunication between the business banker - who we struggle every single time to get hold of - and the bank.
The business banker phoned us again after that and advised us to give him a few days and that he will get back to us again. He never did, and since then any attempt to contact him has failed. In the meantime we are stuck with an account that keeps accruing banking fees which we cannot use or even pay the money into. We are at the point where we want to take away all business and personal matters from Capitec and go to a bank that just cares a bit more about their customers.

2023/07/15 11:18,Phuti M,I will like to warn people about the ***** that is happening through online purchase and the *****ster are aware that we cannot get our money back as they say they talked to us over the phone and there is no proof of record over the phone,Capitec bank said they cannot refund my money back the sum of R3990 which was an online payment which was not agreed for I was phoned by  Hotel stay travel agent telling me about an incredible offer of a once off payment of R399 which we agreed over a phone call and yesterday on the 14th July while I was at work there was an sms of R3990 which was taken from my account when I tried to phone them the phone was not working and at capitec thorn tree soshanguve they said they can't help me we spoke to a bank agent named karabo and she said I agreed to the transaction and there is no proof that it was the wrong amount taken.today morning on the 15th July I went to capitec Montana but they also confirmed that they can't reverse the money as there is no proof that I didn't agree to the money taken from my account but as an account holder I tried to explain to them and provide proof  that I am the account holder and I want justice to be done and the lady named katlego said I am the one who allowed those people to take money from my account by giving them my card number. I am now also querying if the Hotel stay travel agency is for real because later on the have send me a what's up massage saying my package is R16999 then that sum of R3990 is paid once a year meaning next year they are still going to deduct another R3990 so I have told them that we did not agree on that then they said maybe I didn't hear them properly but I don't have any hearing problem.

Two day later on the 27th of June I called her to check if she did receive the money and that was when I she notified me that she cant access her account due to fruadulent reasons. I then called my bank to assist me with reversal and they advised me to send my sister to the Capitec branch with proof of payment so that Capitec can reverse the money back to my account. I did as adviced by my bank my sister went to Diepsloot Mall assisted by Promise, Promise told my sister that I the sender must must call capitec Head Office to query this issue, I the called Capitec Head office I was told that they can't help me because I am not their customer of which it makes sense. then the lady who refused to me her name told me to tell my sister go the branch again. my sister did go to the bank for the second time but different brand when she got to Bambanani Branch in Diepsloot she was assisted by the guy name David Mahlwa. david told her to tell me to go the branch with my ID and Proof of payment as a sender and request reversal.

I went up and down to the branch trying to find out what's happening they were just saying they submitted the required documents to forensic and I'll hear from forensic. I waited for 3 weeks no respond nothing, I decide to call around June then their story changes, now they are telling me that they closed my account due to mole behavior and they won't open it. 

So first it was a certain amount and now that I've submitted what they wanted they are telling me a different and another reason to why they closed my account.  On too of that there's money stuck in there.

2023/07/13 09:57,Jamie-lee Daniels,Urgent Complaint - Incident #**********32,"Urgent Complaint - Incident #**********32

Dear Gerrie Fourie,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my deep frustration and disappointment regarding a recent incident that occurred at the Capitec ATM located at SPAR Grassy Park.

Last night, I attempted to withdraw R200 from the ATM. However, despite my card being dispensed, no cash was received. This has caused me significant inconvenience as I urgently needed the money for my transportation fare. I understand that standard procedure may require a waiting period of 7 days to resolve such issues, but considering the urgency of my situation, I cannot afford to wait.

I have decided to reach out to you directly to highlight the poor service I experienced at your ATM. It is incredibly frustrating to encounter such problems, especially when one relies on these services for daily financial transactions. I expect a much higher level of service and efficiency from Capitec Bank.

I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter and a swift resolution to ensure that I receive the withdrawn amount as soon as possible. I believe it is important for the bank to rectify this issue promptly and prevent similar incidents from happening to other customers.

I would appreciate your urgent intervention and response to this complaint. Please provide me with an update on the progress made in resolving this matter.",1,1,"Good day JamieleeThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/12 12:12,Hendrik S,***** COMPLAINT,"Good day.

On 2 June 2023 around 12:00, I noticed that there were transactions going off from my account. First it was around R820.67, after that another R1023.90, and then yet another R1283.31 and so forth...

I immediately went to the bank to find out what is the problem. To my surprise, after Capitec investigated, it was POS transactions, which means, someone somehow cloned my card and did physical card transactions.

All the amounts added together is almost a STAGGERING R14 000!!!!

After I talked to the Capitec representative, he told be that they will be in contact with me. I admit that they did try and contact me once which I did not answer. Every time I went to the bank they tell me it is going to take up to 7 days...and nothing happens!!

This was the final straw!! Capitec needs to make work of this and make sure I get my money back AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!! If this problem is not cleared up as soon as possible, I WILL close all my account at Capitec and move to another bank or I will continuously report Capitec until this is all cleared up...and also I will lay a complaint at the ombudsman for banks.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE:
I want to take this opportunity to thank the Capitec representative at Capitec Upington - Kalahari Mall. The man that helped me really made an effort to assist me in this matter. The problem I have is with Capitec itself.
 
I really do hope Capitec can assist me in this matter as soon as possible...R14 000 is a very large amount of money.

2023/07/11 21:05,Maria,"Capitec forex not releasing funds, not answering phones or reply to emails whatsoever!","They don't even deserve 1 star!
My salary was paid in from abroad on Tuesday, 5 July 2023. I used to have it sent to my Nedbank account, and then it was in that same afternoon, or at the latest the next morning.
From the morning on Thursday 7 July 2023 I have been calling their forex number on +**********1 because it was already late, hanging on time and again until I eventually gave up after more than half an hour, and once almost 45 minutes! Talking about WASTING airtime, and listening to probably the most annoying voice and message on the planet by now...!
On Friday EVENING 7/7 at 7h13, - SO AFTER BUSINESS HOURS - I received an SMS and an email that they could not get hold of me, so I need to call them to have my funds released. This was as I have mentioned FRIDAY EVENING, and you cannot call them until Monday morning... And then, you have to call them on +**********1, which they just don't answer!
I had no missed calls, so no one tried calling me either!
This is in fact the second time I was informed on a Friday afternoon after business hours that they have money for which I have to call on a Monday, as they could not get hold of me - with no missed calls... That was when I submitted standing instructions!
I was already calling them from Thursday before that, and I started calling again on Monday, and I have sent numerous emails too. In total, I must have spent 3 hours off and on on the phone waiting for someone to answer!
THE WORST OF IT - I HAVE SUBMITTED SIGNED INSTRUCTIONS TO HAVE MY PAYMENT RELEASED AUTOMATICALLY, on their instructions, no need for any calls, last month already!
There is absolutely no reason for this delay, other than Capitec earning interest from retaining client's money in their escrow account for longer!
I am still waiting for my money on 11 July 2023! NO MISSED CALLS, so nobody tried to get back to me either, and neither did they try and email me back! In this case, the person involved who emailed me and then did not bother to follow through, is Ashley Arendse.
This is hands down the worst banking experience I have ever had with any bank, and I have been receiving my salary from abroad since 2009!!
They also progressively moved into the despicable habit of releasing people's money later and later, at the end of the business day and later even after business hours, after they were instructed on releasing the payments first thing that morning!
Other banks release forex within minutes, Capitec drags it's heels until close of business and even later - that is IF THEY RELEASE AT ALL!!!!

The consultant was introduced herself and almost immediately went on the attack.  She claimed that the affidavits that I had submitted by email had not been signed or stamped by a police station.  As I recall, the requirements are to provide sworn statements and a SAPS case number.
As I did not have the information to hand, I said that I would speak to my husband and asked her to call back in 10 minutes.  That was about 28 hours ago.
However, as Capitec seems to read the Hello Peter reviews more avidly than they listen to their customers, I will provide the information that they require here.

2023/07/11 09:24,Lizeka M,Bank that does not communicate period with clients.,This bank is playing with me First of all my account was blocked me being told it’s under investigation just like that with no proper explanation. I last used the account 2019 December and I was told I’ll be sent communication when this was resolved and decided to use another bank. No one communicated with me until funds were deposited mistakably in that account  and Capitec took my money and apparently 2021 my card was used for atm balance enquiry amounting to 1800 who in their right mind would create such expense on their account worse a closed one? I need footage of those transactions because you are quick to deduct money on a closed account according to you of which I suspect internal ****. Why did I not get notification that my account was active and why was it closed in the first place? How do I trust capitec with my money?????,1,1,"Good day LizekaThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/11 09:14,Dean,Capitec credit card ***** is unavoidable.,"Capitec has to have the industry worst credit card security. This is the second time that I have to stop and close a credit card due to ***** and my details being exposed by Capitec. In less than two months from getting a new card (I had to close my old one, because Capitec cannot safeguard the details) AGAIN my details have been exposed and ******. In my first incident I was refunded my ****** money, and I suspect I will be refunded again because Capitec is useless with security and how demonstrated twice now that they simply cannot be trusted with your money and the security of credit cards. I am honestly so disappointed that a business this complex cannot safeguard clients, and worse that I am held accountable financially. You have to stop the card to avoid further transactions, which is sensible, then I have to pay to get it reactivated, which is not. I am cancelling this credit card again and I will never trust Capitec again. I think it is time for a new bank too since once is a accident and twice is a culture.",1,1,"Good day DeanThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/07 13:08,Maureen,CAPITEC'S SCURITY IS AS LEAKY AS A SIEVE AND THEY DON'T CARE,"On 26 May 2023, R98,100 was ****med from my Capitec accounts.  The first feedback I have had was today - 6 weeks later.  I had submitted a full statement to the police on 27th May at the local police station and a SAPS liason officer visited us at our house 28th May to assure me that they would do everything possible to solve this crime. 
I submitted the sworn affidavit by email to Capitec on 28th May and received an email acknowledgement.  I have had nothing since then until this morning.
I emailed, phoned, visited branches during the six weeks and was told that the case was under investigation.  At no time did anyone call or email to update me or even reassure me that they were following up.
The **** was very slick and the money left my account immediately and was dispersed to cash coupons, Nedbank and African Bank within minutes.
The ****mers had full access to my accounts even though I had not given them my account number or pin.  They quoted the names and balances of my five accounts and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, the Capitec recorded message was played while I waited.  
They asked me to generate tokens which I did as I had no notion of the token's use and this apparently allowed them to **** my money.  
I called Capitec while I was still on the phone to the ****mers when I saw that money was leving my coount.  Carlson from Capitec told me that I must cut the ****mers call immediately and that he would block my accounts.   He told me that the monies had already been taken though.
This morning's call from Capitec just made me more unhappy and upset as the advisor demanded that I give her the full deatils of the **** before she would give me any feedback.  I asked why this was necessary as she had the police affidavit.  She insisted that I do so before giving me feedback.  I did so amd she then began to give me safety tips - just as the ****mers had done.  I told her that the only safety tip that I have learnt is not to speak to anyone who says that they're from Capitec and to phone the bank instead.  None of the safety tips that she insisted on giving dealt with generating tokens.
I repeatedly asked her how the ****mers could get into my account without me giving them my log in details.  She was unable to answer except to say that the bank was investigating this.  
A asked again and she said that they were not in my account, it just appeared so because they knew my personal details.  I then asked her how they could move money from my account by me generating a token if they weren't already in my account.  She again said that they could not have been in my account.
What I did manage to learn is that I MAY get some minor amounts back from Nedbank and Africa Bank.  Needless to say, I shall be taking this up with the ombudsman as the issues here are that:
1. I did not give the ****mers my log in details
2. the ****mers were already in my bank account when they called
3. they could not have moved the money from my account my me generating tokens unless they were already in the account.
4. they would have had to set up the payees within my account in order to send money to those payees.
I have debit orders with Capitec and I shall use Capite for these only,  I certainly won't be saving with them in future.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/07 13:08,Tshego B,Pathetic service,"As a customer of capitec bank. The service that is expected to be upholded is pathetic.

From entering the branch at Capitec bank Kathu, the consultant who is suppose to welcoming me and issuing me with a ticket according to my query, was no where near the door. Upon her seeing me, she procedded to the door. She did did even have the decency to greet and apologize for meeting me halfway in the branch as opposed the door. I had to greet her twice in order for her to greet.
Fast forward to siting down waiting for assistance. There are 4 customers waiting in que. Ttwo of the consultants( one with a customer and one without) are having a chat of their lives.. They are clearly talking about something that deemed to be more important that serving the customers in front of them. Finally I get to the service consultant in order to have my card replaced. The one consultant who by the has customers at her cubical, comes over to the consult helping me, and orders her to make sure I am sold a Sim card and buy airtime.

This is not the first time I am. Rexieveinf such pathetic service from Caitec bank Kathu, the one at the shoprite complex. If people do not understand why they are working for an organization that is so hard on customer service then the talk of caring for customers as capitec is nothing but pathetic.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

This is unhuman of Capitec to not even recognize my arrangement or request i am a woman and can't live on the street and not eat. i never once denied that i ow them money. And is willing to make arrangement and make a plan to ensure i have R250 to pay monthly as arranged. 
I am very disappointed with Capitecs service and inhumanity towards me. 
I am only a human that is living in a world where there is suffering all over the place.

2023/07/06 13:02,Shavani G,Capitec Run Around,"Dear Capitec Bank. My Fiance has been given the run around for over three weeks now to remove a prevent status off his name. Initially Capitec Bank (Southdale Branch)was assisting him with his initial application, because the branch did not pick up his company name on their system as well as they could not do confirmation of employment on a Saturday he was told to visit another branch, he did so and in result he had been blocked by Capitec Bank with a prevent status on his name. He contacted the Southdale Branch explaining to his agent (Maulene) as well as the branch manager (Shivesh) that he has now been blocked and they advised that he submits a verification of the business to them to forward to headoffice, he had done so and a few days later his agent (Maulene) had called him and advised that his prevent status had been removed and he could come into the branch and finalize his application. He visited the Trade Route Mall branch the saturday after he received the call from Maulene and dealt with another agent (Dimpho). The agent was not sure of the status of the escalation and advised we go back to the Southdale branch and deal with the agent we were initially dealing with as she could not view anything on her system.In the same day we travelled from Trade Route Mall to Southdale and spoke to a different agent as Maulene was not there, the agent (Pearlz) contacted headoffice over the phone and advised us that she will have to do confirmation of employment in order to lift the status and she would not be able to to it as it was a Saturday.The agent then advised us to return on a weekday and they would be able to confirm his employment. When he had taken a days leave to sort everything out with the bank he called in to find out if he can go to the branch as it would require him to travel, the branch manager (Pumi) had advised him that the block was external and that the branch could not help him and he would have to contact headoffice.He contacted headoffice in the same day and went through to Client care, the legal department, the ***** department, the forensics department and had spoken to the following people, Courtney, Vincent, Nkosinathi, Imraan and lastly was transferred back to client care and spoke to Thabiso. Thabiso advised that the block is called a prevent status and that we should take the latest payslip to our closest branch for them to remove the prevent status beacuse the call centre is unable to do so. In the very same day we went back to the Trade Route Mall branch and spoke to Dimpho again, she was confused and checked everything on her system, she then was able to let us know that headoffice required certain documents from the company such as verification of the company, CIPRO documents as well as his payslips and confirmation of employment, we arranged for those documents and submitted them to Trade Route Mall Capitec and we were told that they would have to review the documents and will provide us with feedback. Today we had called the capitec branch and spoken to the branch manager (Pitsetso) and was told that she had been trying to contact the company with no luck, I had tried explaining to her that the number was incorrect and she told me that she gets her numbers from Google, I am the Marketing Manager for the exact same company and the Google profiles are my responsibility, I had rectified the error on the google profile and had called Trade Route Mall back to confirm if they have the correct contact information, the correct information was confirmed by Pitsetso and we were told that she would do the confirmation but there is still more processes to follow. We are currently awaiting any kind of feedback from Capitec and are honestly loosing any kind of patience we currently have. We have been Capitec clients for years and have also taken out finance with Capitec before, Capitec has proven to be delayed and have an issue with communication between the branches and headoffice. We are currently considering to close all accounts we currently have with 
Capitec and utilizing a different bank. Our Director has also stated that she will be avoiding any employees banking with Capitec as we are the 3rd party in the company to have an issue like this with Capitec.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I tried calling Capitec and every time they transfer you to the foreign exchange department no one answers, I have already spent R200 calling and till now I am still not getting through.

2023/07/05 12:47,Katherine L,WORST SERVICE | *****| 2 MONTHS and NO FEEDBACK or MONEY BACK!!!!,"My Capitec app/savings account was hacked, close to 300k was transferred out of my account. I reported it immediately to Capitec, reported to the police, got the affidavit and they told me that in 21 days I would have a response and my funds would be retrieved from those bank accounts the ******* transferred money to, I have been locked out of my account for 2 months, 21 days has come and gone and no feedback from Capitec. I have had to go in every week to try and get information but their branch agents can't get any info from their ***** department who promise to call me but never do... Thandi, never called, Thandile says theres a backlog but never called and there is no update. This is 90% of my savings!!! I should not have to chase my own bank for feedback, your ***** department are under skilled and aren't equipped for events such as these, you should take a page out of the likes of FNB, Discovery and actually any other bank because you are just as bad as the ******* that stole my money! I am reporting you to the ombudsman, and I have escalated to their CEO, their complaints department and have posted on facebook but no response... This bank does not care about their clients. I just want my money back, I have done everything that was asked , this entire experience has been so traumatic and stressful and Capitec has not been supportive at all, their service is shocking... at this point, I would never recommend them as your money is not safe. Here is my email to their complaints department: 
HI,
Capitec, your service is shocking and sadly, I am going to have to report you to the ombudsman if this is not resolved, your timeframe to secure my funds that were *****ulently transferred out of my account on the 1st of May 2023 was 21 days, but you never contacted me with any updates, and still have not. 2 MONTHS LATER AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY MONEY OR ANY FEEDBACK!!!!
This isn't a small amount of money, this is close to 300k, you were able to reverse 95k because it was in a pending state however, you said you had to deal directly with the banks where the other 80k, 90k, 40k etc was transferred to, in order to put those accounts on hold so that the ******* did not use the funds. DID THIS HAPPEN? WHO KNOWS, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY FEEDBACK!
WHY HAVE I NOT RECEIVED MY MONEY BACK? WHY HAS NO ONE CALLED ME TO TELL ME THE PROGRESS? 
I have had to go into your branch in sea point almost every week after the initial 21 days because I was told that no one would contact me during the 21 days as they would be dealing with the banks where the funds were transferred to and it is against the POPI ACT to discuss anything around those accounts and the account holders. So, trusting that my bank would handle this for me, and because Capitec is insured for instances like this, I waited... 
This is the worst service, and I honestly would never recommend anyone to open an account with you as your ***** team is shockingly unskilled and unprepared for events like this, what bank does not monitor such large amounts of transactions???? Every other bank would put a hold and confirm with the client but NO, capitec does not track these things, your app is extremely unsecure and you could take a page out of other banks books on how to deal with their customers and also in reference to cybersecurity and having a skilled ***** team. 
I have been locked out of my account for 2 months... and your poor branch agents have had to deal with an extremely irate customer but only because your ***** department has no idea what is happening and because for 2 months you have not contacted me via email, phone or even JUST GETTING MY MONEY BACK FROM THOSE WHO STOLE IT! CAPITEC , YOU ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE AND SHOULD TRANSFER THE AMOUNTS BACK INTO MY ACCOUNT! You can continue to deal with the other banks, and retrieve the funds at your own pace, but you need to put those funds back into my account. 
Each time I have gone, I have had to wait 2 to 3 hours whilst your agents try to get hold of your ***** department... second last visit, they spoke to a Thandi, who was supposed to call me before 5pm, guess what? THANDI DID NOT CALL ME! I waited another couple of days hoping that , hoping CAPITEC would call me with an update as to where my money is, what they are doing about the account owners the funds were transferred to, but no, nothing!
I went to the bank once again in sea point on Monday the 2nd of July 2023 and was there for 2 hours whilst the branch manager tried to get hold of the ***** department, Thandi the team lead was in a meeting and didn't feel it was a priority to provide an update, they managed to touch base with her Manager THANDILE, and his response was to the branch manager at sea point Capitec "" THERE IS A MASSIVE BACKLOG""... Well, Capitec, that really isn't my problem, I followed all the steps , reported it to the police, got an affidavit, which was traumatic in itself after almost my entire savings was taken out of my account. You have everything you need, to retrieve those funds from the banks the ******* sent the money to, but the victim has had NO SUPPORT FROM CAPITEC! 
I EXPECT AN ANSWER AND PROGRESS REPORT, WITH A DATE OF WHEN I WILL RECEIVE ALL FUNDS *****ULENTLY TRANSFERRED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT BY THE END OF THIS WEEK!!!!
Over 2 months is way past your standard 21 day timeframe you provided me, this entire ordeal has been extremely traumatic!

2023/07/05 07:54,Simphiwe M,Capitec Bank card is not working at Capitec ATMs but others,"HELLO PETER #CAPITEC 

My capitec card expired 2025 and already it's not working on your new ATMs, this is so inconveniencing, I have to use other banks (which cost me more) or retailers to withdraw money it's really disturbing, your own card is not working on your own ATM? where do you want me to withdraw my money if my card is not working to your ATMs? Please note that MY CARD IS NOT DAMAGED it's working very well in any other banks atm or retailers. My card picture attached.

I went to one of Capitec branches in Johannesburg CBD, one of their consultant went out with me to their ATMs, we tried 3 different ATMs, they all rejected my card. We tried the Old Mutual ATM which was close, successfully I withdrawn R3000 which I desired to withdrawn. All this was to prove that my card doesn't have problem. The consultant insisted for me to buy another card which will cost me R70 or so, I refused to do so as I also paid for my current card for service that will end in 2025. Then he advised to escalate the matter as he can't help me further. I tried other platform including Facebook, Email to communicate with them but no luck to solve this problem. 

I write this complaint to seek for help. Capitec to programme their atms to be accessible to my current bank card as my card still valid or give me new card without me paying for it, even if the card is short dated to 2025. This matter might affect other customers if not already. 

Hopefully this platform can help urgently as I am running on unpleasant situation here.

I am even thinking of canceling or close my account and join other bank that is in my mind. Shift my salary to it as I don't know where this problem can lead to deadly situation.

Their app can't recall a transaction if you payed a beneficiary on their correct number that is not linked to their account, I don't understand why are they having that option to pay someone using their cell phone number instead of their Acc. Now that I payed someone on thier correct number that is not linked to their account. I must now go to court and open up a civil claim.

Because my friend doesn't have  an email address that is registered with capitec for them to contact him however they have access to my account and detail of the number I used to pay him.

Sorry we are not allowed to make contact. Best option is court. Capitec bears no responsibility for your money once you've sign up with them.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I received a notification from my account for the amount of R1011, 83 from my account with a funny reference number, I immediately called capitec and informed them about that unauthorized transaction they told me that the only thing they can do is to block my card and they will do the investigation which will take 30 days. I couldn't wait for 30 days for my money. I then complained at Hello Peter, they immediately attendend my case. They refunded me withing 4 days instead of the 30 days they told me about. After receiving my refund they called me to confirm if I did receive my refund, I confirmed that, received the refund. Few hours after confirming ang the refund they deducted the same amount again without even notifying me. I just saw the notification going through in my account with the same amount that was refunded. Capitec is the worst bank. Stay away from Capitec.

2023/07/04 08:05,Totius W,Capitec gives clients personal details to third parties in branch!!,"On the 1st July 2023 a payment was made into my account by a third party of which I did not recognise the payment details. I assumed that the money was paid to my account by mistake, and that the bank will contact me to reverse the transaction to which I have no problem as it is the stand up thing to do.

As the payment was made on a Saturday, I assumed that Capitec would contact me on Monday the 3rd July 2023. To my surprise, Monday at 16:41 PM I received a phone call from a lady (Mrs. E Baloyi) explaining to me that a payment was made to my account by mistake and it is my responsibility to pay it back to her account. I don’t know this lady and I have never met her before. 

Having worked in the banking industry for over 20 years I know it is against the bank’s conduct to disclose any personal information without your consent to any third party. The bank is to contact the client (me), explain the situation, provide details regarding the transaction and confirm reversal of the funds with acknowledgement. 

I explained to Mrs. Baloyi that the correct way to go about the reversal of the funds was to go to a Capitec branch and they will assist with the matter at hand. When I asked her where she got my name and number, she dropped the line. She then called back at 16:44 and I asked her again where she got my personal details and she dropped the line again.

At 16:45 PM I received a phone call from someone telling me that they are from Capitec and explained to me that the client made a mistake with the transfer. She entered the wrong last digit of the bank account to which she wanted to transfer to. I explained that I understand and then asked the person where Mrs. Baloyi got my personal details from? The person then started to explain the mistake that was made and I explained that I understand the situation but, I want to know who gave her my personal information? 

The person then went on saying that Capitec head office have been trying to contact me the entire day without any luck. I did not receive any calls from Capitec prior to Mrs Baloyi contacting me. Again I asked where Mrs Baloyi got my personal information from, the line was dropped. 

After a couple of minutes I received a call from a third person explaining to me they are from Capitec, they explained the situation once again and I asked the person who gave my personal information to Mrs Baloyi? The person once again started to explain the situation and I explained to him that I am going to report this matter to the ***** department if they don’t tell me who gave permission to provide my personal information to a third party. 

I explained that this is against law to give my information to any third party without consent. I dropped the line. The bank is to protect your information as stipulated in the POPI Act for as long as the bank-customer relationship exists and beyond. 

Hopefully I will get feedback from the bank today else, I am escalating the matter to the Ombudsman and contacting Devi from The Devi Show investigate the matter.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/07/03 16:49,Khanyisile D,Capitec Loan,"I have a loan with Capitec, I went to maternity last year in September and I submitted all my documents they needed since I wasn’t going to get paid. So they continued debiting I went to the bank again they said I need to put money for the access fee my loan will be paused until I go back to work but that never happened. In December 2022 when my UIF money got in Capitec debited that money I owed for 3 months.
I made that slide to avoid emotional stress which would have affected the baby.

Now in April 2023 I changed banking details and advices then telephonically they said it has been changed only to find out that they were just passing time, come May the 25 they threatening me that I need to make payment I’m owing. I went to the branch in Eastgate we called the accounts department and they changed them I paid manually. Now in June they didn’t debit I called the accounts on the 26th to check why they haven’t debited the agent said no your account is up to date I asked him to confirm which bank it was taken from he said there was an EFT payment received yesterday 25th June 2023. I sent an email to the collection department they also confirmed that they received money I’m not owing. 
On the first of July at 00:30am I received an sms stating that no money was received. Mind you September it’s the last month of debit and this is how they treat me as a customer. 
I have been referring people to take loans from Capitec but after this I won’t even go back there for anything I do t know if it’s because I’m black or what I’m very angry",1,0,I called the collectors only to find out that my cellphone number was captured wrong and my account number all they said is that I need to do payment arrangements to extend my paymentsxa0Like what pyramid scheme are these people runningxa0,2023-07-10 12:08:59

2023/07/03 09:05,Graham S,Capitec Business Shocking Service AS ALWAYS,"I am ONCE AGAIN leaving a poor review of Capitec Business.  Many issues have still not been resolved and old ones have even come up again.  The only way I get any help is when a Hello Peter complaint is active and I have brought this up to my banker, the manager and the Hello Peter team.  The service is still the same as in you won't get any unless you make a scene.  Horrible to have to do this every time I need something.  

I emailed my business banker 2 weeks ago and I still have yet to get a response, trust me you won't manage to get through to him on the phone.  I have mentioned it on whatsapp to the manager 3 times in the last 2 weeks that I am waiting for a reply I have not got a response but every time I mention it to him it is ignored.  I get a reply like ""Hi Graham""  and then nothing after that?!

I have for months been asking why my card won't swipe on STD Bank POS machines and each time it is just left and let to slip through the cracks.  I now have not got sms notifications for a month which I have been trying to sort out with them but trust me they care very little about customer issues other than ""we've escalated it to the complaints department"" who do nothing, I've heard it over a dozen times only for my issues to get dropped.

The card doesn't have the functionality to pay for tolls (because how could tolls ever be a business expense?) you can't buy airtime, data or electricity so a lot of fun for my accountant to sort out balancing things moving money through personal accounts for business expenses.  On Friday my card didn't work on 4 separate occasions over the period of several hours, eventually after several messages to the manager I get a response that there was a temporary error and it is resolved.. guess what it wasn't and I still couldn't draw money for salaries and when I sent another picture of the error it was ignored and I got 0 response.  The system often has issues, has extremely limited functionality and the service level is down the toilet unless you complain on Hellopeter or make a scene and hound these guys (where you get the absolute minimum service).  We have opened another account in Std bank where we at least have functionality, I wish we had never opened an account with Capitec Business and I implore you do not make the mistake we made.  This must be over my 6th complaint here because they just don't care or follow up with issues, you will get ignored multiple times.  Oh a fun time was the previous banker who BLOCKED me on whatsapp, how dare customers follow up on ignored issues and messages!",1,1,"Good day Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Okay went into the branch (they were very helpful)they also can’t access my funeral details, they called BCS or BSC also the person on the other end couldn’t assist and was clueless and I left without my dependent being added cos they CANT ACCESS my funeral details. Mind you deductions have been going through monthly without fail. If this was a funeral claim I would have been doomed. The matter was also ascalated .

I honestly understand why consumers dislike Capitec and this is because of their shady business. I pay my credit card fees and amount owing without fail before 55 days which means I do not get an interest charge but guess what this ****ttttyyyyyy customer does ??? they charge me R274 every month for transfer payment to my credit card account to pay for it. imagine a R274 just for them to debit my main Capitec Savings account to my credit card. What on earth is that ? Like which other facility does this ? I am currently reaching out to Nedbank to pls give me a credit card again so I can pay off this nonsensical company and shut my account. I will also be closing off my Main Account where I get my salary, cancelling funeral insurances etc. Capitec Bank is shady and nowhere can they give me a breakdown of what causes a single transfer charge to be R274.

2023/07/01 19:39,Adrian S,Capitec: General Power of Attorney - they don't know to what department to send it to,"Everything time I have to deal with Capitec Bank, I take headache tablets and something to keep me calm.

Your business processes are pathetic. Bankers and back-office agents aren't even in agreement/aligned with each other, or even better, neither of them knows what to do, so, I am on the phone for an ±1-hour while at a branch in front of the banker also phoning and being transferred, and transferred, and transferred, but to no avail.

Recent Incident:
My mother's debit card was lost on the 28th/29th. She called to cancel/shred the card. This was done. No Incident Number was provided by the agent, we are not responsible for the agent to do the job they are trained to do.

My mother is bedridden with advanced Multiple Sclerosis. She cannot get out of bed. So, the agent advised us to acquire a General Power of Attorney document. So we had our lawyer draft it and it was ratified. Per the advise if the call center agent, I went to a branch, and go into this branch with this legal document and FICA documents of the account holder, my mother, and the select agent for Power of Attorney.

The banker had no idea what to do and kept phoning the helpline. I started phoning the helpline and finally, the banker and I received some sort of answer to send the General Power of Attorney to ***********.

In the meantime, she cannot pay for subscription services loaded on her card. Her keychain's battery is also flat, guess what, we need to go into a branch (very old and extremely antiquated compared to other top five banks I was/am contracted to.) Banks are moving to digital transformation. Bank Zero, Thyme Bank, Nedbank, FRB and Standard Banks are CLOSING branches because of their powerful feature-rich and self-servicing capabilities within their respective Apps. But Capitec's #1 answer to anything is ""come into a branch"". Ever heard of voice biometrics? Guess not.

Bottomline: My mother does not have mobile banking active to run USSD codes. She does not have the Banking App (because you need to go into a BRANCH TO ACTIVE IT!?), cannot log in via the website because the ancient 2FA token/keyring's battery is flat, and can't do anything using the WhatsApp service.

The General Power of Attorney has been to submit to the email address ***********, assuming it is the correct email address to send sensitive documents to? 

The Power of Attorney needs to be accepted by Capitec to allow the selected agent on her behalf to get a new debit card from the branch. Have the banking App installed on her phone. Have the mobile App generate the 2FA to log into the Web Portal to allow her. Manage her retirement investments and much-needed money for her health insurance and medications, and additional medical expenses. 

Please escalate this. Figure out what department to escalate it to. After this struggle, we are looking to move to FNB or Nedbank purely due to the slow pace and lack of business process/procedure/Way of Working/competence. This issue is directly blocking her from paying medical expenses.",1,1,"The reviewer has replied privately, and only Capitec Bank can view this message.",2023-07-01 19:42:13

I phoned Capitec told them how much I had last night and how much was missing this morning. the first agent was surprised and told me they dont deduct from access facility but do so on normal savings account but she'll transfer me to a person that can assist. The second agent saw the money that went out but could not tell to which account so after being on the phone with her for 40min she promised to investigate and call back. 

She did so within 10 minutes and told me that they deducted interest, disability and admin fees which amounted to R924 not the R926 missing. When I told her that interest and all admin fees were already deducted from my savings account on the 23rd all amounting to R2200+ I also transferred extra amount when I got paid. She saw all those transactions so, I asked if it was Capitec habit to access customer's other accounts and double deduct from supposedly safe accounts.. She couldnt answer me then i asked her to go and investigate further and come back with a response... she never returned. This was the 2nd time Capitec took money from my access facility with no explanation.

The system  kept failing and not even the scanner was working, I understand this is not a problem an employee can do anything  about.id prior been asked to bring my payslip and I would be assisted (ref capitec fourways), I got the payslip and went to creddlestone where I encountered the problem.

Staff told me it looked like the people from the head office nocked off and he'll contact Me on monday(26 June 2023) with feedback which he never called me.

Im only receiving the call today which they are telling me that I must again go back to the bank for them to call while I'm there.

This is unacceptable service they are telling they tried to contact me to no success which I have no record of.

They are refusing to email me the said feedback and for some reason the manager felt the need to jump in on the call at yell at me to give me the number to call instead when I asked them to tell the said office to call me to arrange for same.

Why must I wait for a week? Then yell at me you couldn't find me?

There are no accessible physical branches -Capitec still refers you to Merchantile Call center.

2023/06/30 14:05,Dudu,Capitec intentionally affects credit score over a debt settled in 2021,"Capitec Bank is a really disappointing institution, I settled my credit card debt with them in 2021 with their collections company after losing my job. Upon settlement, I was given a letter that neither myself nor Capitec can make any further claims on said account. Capitec still says I owe them R25.00 every single month just to affect my credit score. I have reported it from 2021 until now. No one wants to assist, I am sent from pillar to post over what I no longer owe. As you may know, I am unable to obtain a home loan or any credit for that matter, I have furnished all proof of settlement to Capitec, MBD and Credit Bureaus. Next stop is the banking ombudsman.

2023/06/30 08:27,Candice R,Took my kids food money!!!,So when you request a certain debit date i love how these ****** consultants just brush you off. I specifically told them to debit me on the 3rd of the month as that is my salary date and despite that i have asked them more than once i asked the consultant 4 times to be exact when taking out a loan they go ahead and debit the money today which was my Childs money for food over the weekend and her school lunches for next week as my salary comes in late. I mean why even bother trying to make ends meet and plan ahead when you get thrown into this kind of **** and nothing you can do about it. none the less i have to beg her father to take her this weekend because that money for her is now gone and my food is running on very low. Thank you capitec for making my case of custody weaker and create an image like i cannot see to my kid. People need to start listening when we say debit a certain date i want this removed rather then have us eft we have selected dates for budget reasons! Absolutely fuming you affecting my child and me now!!! Let this custody battle make me loose full custody you will see me in court this is unacceptable! I will be warning everyone of this **** not to mention if it bounced i must endure the costs i told you people to debit my account on the 3rd of the month ****** hell. I am a single mom and under stress as it is without worrying about food for my kid let alone myself! Why did the consultant just tell me what the issue is that she cant load it for the 3rd but she **** to my 4 times stating she set it for the 3rd i dont need to stress...

Still to date the bank I bank with, can't help me because the money was paid into another business account. 

How is that even possible? Am I not suppose to be the client that you help first?

2023/06/26 18:20,Mandisa,Poor Service,"Good Day,

I'd like to review Capitec Bank on very poor service and failing to even come back to me as a client. My review is related to the concerned ref number.
***** Case : **********7

I reported ***** on my account in August 2022 and received the above ref number for follow up purposes. On a couple of the calls I made to the bank, I was notified by several agents that just over R2000 was retrieved and that it would take about 6 weeks for ***** investigations to be conducted and that this would be followed by repatriation of the funds back into my account.
Each time I made a call, I was advised of the same waiting period. 
Its a year later and I've never received a call from Capitec.

I would like feedback on what transpired and why I wasn't serviced, as a customer.
Also why I wasn't paid the money back into my account.
I want the money paid back to me accordingly.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/26 12:05,Lorenzo K,Access facility and credit profile update,"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an ongoing issue that I have been experiencing with my access facility account since 2022. Despite my best efforts to address the matter, the problem persists, and I am seeking your assistance in resolving it.

The specific issue I am facing pertains to irregularities in the debit and credit transactions associated with my account. On certain occasions, there have been no debits recorded, while my credit score account has been updated as being in arrears. This discrepancy is a cause for concern, as it inaccurately reflects my financial standing and may have a negative impact on my credit profile.

In an attempt to rectify the situation, I visited my local branch and consulted with one of their agents. They promptly contacted the relevant department, which informed us that the debit order mandate was not active. During the call, it was observed that the debit order mandate had been canceled, and I was required to accept a new one. However, upon leaving the branch, I discovered that the debit order mandate had been canceled once again, this time by the service provider ""Capitec.""

My primary concern lies with the inaccurate update on my Credit Check profile, where I have been listed as non-paying despite the absence of any debits from my account. This issue has persisted for an extended period, and despite my efforts, I have not received any meaningful assistance in resolving it. I am particularly worried that, if this matter remains unresolved, there may be no debit order recorded for June, further exacerbating the situation and potentially leading to my credit profile being marked as in arrears.

Understanding the importance of maintaining a healthy credit score, I kindly request any assistance or guidance you can provide to help address this matter effectively. It would be greatly appreciated if you could investigate the issue thoroughly, liaise with the relevant parties involved, and take the necessary steps to rectify the inconsistencies in my credit profile.

Should there be any additional information required from my end to facilitate this investigation, please do not hesitate to let me know. I am eager to cooperate fully and provide any relevant documentation or details that may aid in the resolution process.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter and for your prompt assistance in rectifying the issues with my credit profile. I look forward to a swift resolution, as it will greatly alleviate the concerns I currently face.",5,1,"Good day LorenzoThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/26 10:51,Rianie N,Poor service at Capitec,"On the 6th of May I collected a NEW card at Capitec Kolonnade Retail Park, Pretoria, 2 hours after there went some money off from Le Daniel (which is a Restaurant in French).  I immediately contacted Capitec to report the ***** transaction - The person told me that they can see it's a Card transaction from Le Daniel in French, so they give me a reference number for the call.  (This was the second time in one week that there went money off from my account from overseas businesses, while I'm in South Africa and not doing any online shopping) I did a follow up and they say it's still been investigating. I phoned again to ask who long the investigation takes and they said 30 days - according to them was the 30 days on the 19th June, because they not working on weekends. I phoned on the 20th June again and the guy told me NO investigation take 30 days, he will lock the incident again (with a new reference number) and I will receive my money with in 24 - 72 hours.  I phoned on Friday the 23rd June again, because it was after 72 hours, the lady said it's at the Dispute department, but, she can't get hold of anyone, and she will ask them to call me - no one called me till today 26.June.  I phoned again this morning, because this is the poorest of poor serviced that I ever received from any bank. The one lady told me that the first incident was opened on the 6th of May and was closed on the 17th of May (No communication or money was paid back).   It's almost 2 months that I struggle to get any communication from Capitec - every time when I phone, they have a different excuse not to help the customer and to NOT pay back the customers money that was a lack of security on Capitec security. I will spread the words to all my Family and friend of the POOREST service I have with Capitec.",1,1,"Good day Rianie Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/26 10:29,Amy B,Avoid Capitec if you can!!,"Avoid Capitec if you can!! They do not look out for their customers money.
I was subject to a ***** **** and had R1700 ****** out of my account. This was in the form of an online transaction. (As I now understand this is quite a well know **** in the courier industry and banks should also be well aware of it. Banks should therefore take the neccessary steps to stop/avoid it from happening).
I was awaiting a package, and the ****mers sent me an SMS which said that I need to pay R4 for the package to be released. Upon clicking the link I  was redirected to a site which appeared legitimate. I entered the required fields, and within minutes I had R500 and R1200 deducted from my account. I immediately went to a Capitec branch and asked them to reverse these *****ulent amounts.  I was informed that they first had to launch an investigation and that I might or might not get my money back. For this service I had to pay an additional R85. I never heard a word back from Capitec. Eventually I contacted them on Capitec Whatsapp, only to be informed that this was Card Swipe and Pin transaction and therefore they could not do anything about it. I was given a number to call, from which I got the same story.
Now the strange bit, I was sitting in my office in George in the WC and got an SMS at 10.59, I followed the online prompts and at 11.06 the transactions went out of my account...... wait for it......... my card supposedly swiped in Jhb!!! 
For a swipe transaction you need to have a card and a pin as far as I am aware, for security purposes this is why banks issue cards. My card would need to have been cloned and all of this took place in 6 to 7 minutes and 1200km apart. 
To my mind there has been a breach in bank security or even worse, there may be inside help for an individual inside of Capitec. How does one expain the cloned card 1200km away within 7 minutes.
My questions are;
How can Capitec not do the immediate reversal when reported?
How can the card be cloned 1200km away?
Why do Capitec not respond, and charge a fee for the dis-service?
When I called again today I was made to hold 35 minutes (I have the screenshot as proof), and nobody reappeared to the call. Is this a strategy to avoid dealing with issues?
Today I get a new Ref No. and told I will be contacted within 2 weeks (I'm not convinced that I will be contacted at all - same as before)
Disgusting, slow, non-responsive, don't get all the facts, take the low road, so that the customer must take the loss and the bank has no expense to sort out nor investigate the real issues.
The result - I, my husband, my sister will be leaving Capitec and I will warn as many people as possible, to avoid these banksters who are happy to take your money, but not take care of your money.",1,1,"Good day AmyThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/24 15:37,Adri P,Frustrating Capitec does not care about customers.,"I've had multiple issues in such a short time, it's honestly frustrating and so disappointing. Numerous times my card would not work at a store or petrol station and I was told there's nothing they can do. Don't even get me started on the rude careline lady, I could go on about it for days. Next I had an unauthorized deduction from my credit card that was part of a ****. I immediately stopped my card and reported it to Capitec. When I followed up a week later I was told the complaint was considered closed and later that there was actually nothing linked to the complaint. This was ridiculous as I never had any further communication from Capitec regarding the investigation or the reason for the outcome. I managed to talk to someone else that actually sorted it out and my money was eventually paid back. If I never followed up they wouldn't have even thought twice about the outcome and I honestly wonder if this is their standard operating procedure to avoid paying back ****** money. Now, I made a payment to a beneficiary who is also at Capitec and that I've paid before, but for some reason I cannot get a proof of payment?! I've tried multiple times on my end and ended up calling the careline, again. And surprise surprise, once again there is ""nothing they can do"". They are escalating it but it will only be attended to it next week.... I need a proof of payment for a service due on Monday, is Capitec going to be held liable for the inconvenience or the double payment I'll need to make to ensure there is at least a proof of payment??

2023/06/23 15:16,Charis C,Capitec has ****** our money,"This is taking me so long to sort out because both my parents have stage four cancer. 
An item was advertised for sale for R800 by my partner, Mr Tyron Love, and bought by Mr Jayesh on 15 November 2022, who paid though ABSA. He asked for the tracking number and was provided with the one Mr Love received from Postnet.

When Mr Jayesh went to Postnet he was told there is no such tracking number (he had requested it too early for it to be logged into the system). Due to this he thought ***** had taken place and retracted his money from his bank (ABSA) and also sent my Mr Love messages saying he had de*****ed him.

When the tracking number appeared, Mr Love sent it to Mr Jayesh who then apologized profusely via text, and informed his bank that no ***** had taken place (REF No :ASZA-2**********8).

Upon visiting Capitec to find out why the app was not working, I was told my account had been flagged for *****. I explained the situation and showed the text from Mr Jayesh, but Capitec require an affidavit from the police from Me (Miss C Charlton, account holder), in order to unblock the account. Capitec Reference Number: **********22.

I informed the manager that my partner Mr Love and I are severely immune compromised and would prefer not to have to visit a police station seeing as this was not our fault at all, yet Capitec requires this affidavit in order to unblock my bank account.

2023/06/23 08:31,Sinazo M,ANGRY AND DISAPPOINTED CLIENT,"Good day 

I need assistance  immediately with this issue. This morning 23/06/2023 I had money deducted out of my account (R1500) written set-off app**** and noticed that I have been having these amounts. I called client care and the lady that was assisting found it very difficult to begin to trace what could have happened until it was evident that Client care (Capitec Bank ) made this deduction without my concern  . And as it stands Client Care had sent R3000 on the 5th June without me being aware as this account is on daily use for my customers  and I still don't understand why and how it happened . They  are now deducting amounts from my account at their own accord without my concern and approval. I am not only angry but extremely frustrated and disappointed with this service. I told the lady that I need my money reversed into my account immediately as I'm not informed and involved in any manner with the activities taking place in my account. I have use for that money today and now. I will go spread this on all social media platforms of Capitec and how I didn't even get assistance of getting my money back immediately after I called client care. The bank did their own errors and should not by any chance affect me , and even worse that they did not communicate they just decided to deduct money which I need to use today. So I want my money now. And I expect someone to come explain what actually took place and what is happening right now in my account and with all these untraceable funds. I am highly shocked with this and question the safety of my money in the accounts I use that are linked with Capitec Bank (From personal account, children's accounts and business bank account ). Attend to this immediately. At this moment I need my funds in my account as I need to use them.

2023/06/22 18:50,Dumisane M,*****ulent or Unauthorised transaction from my Capitec Acoount.,"The amount of R486 was deducted from my Capitec account on the 4th of June by a company called Accelerit (internet company) without my permission and I made a call to the bank to be aware of an unauthorised transaction that was made from my account and sadly I was told to wait 24 hours for my query to be resolved but there is no solution to date.
I ended up visiting the Lenasia Branch on the 6th of June 2023 for further management where I was assisted by Raeesa the consultant who further escalated my matter to the bank's ***** department and told me the ***** department will be in contact with me after changing an unexpired bank card for R70(unplanned expense where the bank profited). She reassured me that the bank will resolve my matter within a week or so but to date nobody from the bank side has ever bothered to contact me nor has my money been paid back into my account. 
The sad part is I don't have any existing contract with the above-mentioned company, and I wonder if it's still safe to continue with Capitec bank services where our hard-earned monies are so vulnerable to predator companies and instead of assisting regarding the matter, they just wanted to gain from the problem I'm having. 
One thing I like about FNB is there's an option to reverse unauthorised deductions and even to reverse a mere EWallet from an unknown or incorrect beneficiary IMMEDIATELY unlike Capitec where you have to be sent from pillar to post for your money to be returned into your account. I'm considering switching to FNB because of Capitec's POOR SERVICE.",1,1,"Good day DumisaneThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

so now I had a client that wanted to rent my place and she paid a deposit into my bank account. she was supposed to move in  on the 1stof june and she didn't she said she will move in on the 15th on the 8th she sent a text saying she got a job offer somewhere she won't be moving in anymore and that she wants her money back. I told her I can't give her the money back because the place was reserved for her for the month. she then went to Capitec notifying them that she paid the money into my account wrongfully and that she was ****med by me. so now Capitec has closed my account without my side of the storey. I had to go to the police station to do an affidavit giving the side of myh storey still I get no response from Capitec.
Again I don't understant why is Capitec intefeering with my account as this is a civil matter and has nothing to do with them. the least they could have done was to investigate all transactions in my account to see if any of them could be labelled as a **** or ***** but they haven't done that.
this is the worst bank one could wish to bank with

I sat and waited while this happened and then realized the number that defaulted for the company to confirm employment as stated is INCORRECT. I kindly tried to inform the manager with regards to same but without even acknowledging me as a CLIENT shud me off rudely and said !I CANNOT TAKE ANYTHING FROM YOU!.. SURELY , there must be a better and polite way in informing clients of the important steps that must be followed. I felt totally disrespected and vented my feelings to the consultant as this Doohan Viljoen showed NO RESPECT as he rushed off to verify WITH THE INCORRECT PHONE NUMBER!!

It now requires you to take selfies to make transfers. This is both inconvenient and intrusive. I do not want this nor have agreed to this. Their service has been subpar as of late and it continues to degrade. I will list the response I got from them below.

2023/06/21 10:16,Christa,Capitec Bank,"From the month of April there are overseas companies that want to deduct money from my capitec account. I am forced to keep my virtual card's amount at R0,00. But now money is deducted by Capitec every time when overseas companies want to check if there is money in my account. I have been to the bank twice and each time they say I have to unsubscribe. The only place I'm subscribed to is youtube because I don't like ads. I can't close my account either because then I have to pay a fine of R7000 to release my fixed investment.

2023/06/20 12:24,zamasotobe S,****MED BY CAPITEC BANK AND ****MERS,"i have had a capitec account since i was a teenager and have been using it for well over a decade. A few weeks ago i had a debit order go through my account while i was sleeping for R191.30 (myelectronicsclub)and then shortly after i received another for R142.77 (purefit) with a different reference. i immediately went on my app and tried moving my funds to a different account as i was not sure what was going on and it was late afternoon on a saturday when the capitec nearest to me had already closed- the app was not working and therefore could not transfer funds. i then saw on my app that the transactions appeared under online transactions and not on the debit order tab. I contacted ********** and asked consultant i was speaking to what exactly was going on on my app as unauthorised transactions were going through. the attempted to send me a link that i had to accept but for some reason the link kept saying ""verification failed and we ended call with her saying she cant help without approval from link and also confirmed it wasnt a debit order. ok cool .""Another transaction went off again from myelectronicsclub. 
next morning i went to the bank where consultant called ***** department and spoke to ***** department on my behalf (i don''t know why this is done when i should be one speaking so i can ask quetsions to get better clarity). ANyway according to her the transactions were an online purchase and i would have to find the companies and request my money. I explained to them that i did not know these companies and had not purchased from them, she said unfortunately they cant help me. she then suggested that they would be able to block the reference for the two transactions but should the companies change their references their transactions would go thorough as they would have blocked that one specific reference. consultant then said that will be all she can help with i then asked that we close the account as i have no assurance that these transactions would not happen again and Capitec seems to distance themselves from any responsibility (at some point i asked if it was an online transaction would i not get notification and need to go to my app and approve the transaction? she could not respond). I was told i cant cancel the card as there were pending transactions i asked what transactions as money had already taken from account. no answer. 
i sent Capitec Twitter a DM asking for assistance as i felt that branch was not helpful in providing solution to my problem, the SM account responded and said i need to go to back which i stated i had done and was not assisted and they insisted i should go there. 
A few days later another two transactions went through with similar amounts and i immediately sent SM account a message to ask how its possible that the same account that was ""blocked"" as per conversation with branch consultant is now still able to access my money i was told that it was the consultants fault that i was not informed or advised to cancel my bank card as this is best or only way to stop these transactions so i asked so now that consultant had not suggested that what should happen and i was told unfortunately nothing could be done. so not the lady spoke to on phone on saturday or person on SM saturday that i spoke too , not the bank consultant or ***** department person or person on SM could tell me to cancel my card???? and my money vanished!! And no one wants to aco****able and this means people could loose serious money because the bank does not think someone having access to your account without you authorising it is allowed and ethical. disgusting!!",1,1,"Good day Zamasotobe Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/19 13:57,Tshimangadzo R,Unfortunate Bias and Lack of Transparency (Capitec protecting Clientele *****ulent debit orders): My Experience with Capitec's Handling of a Disputed Debit Order,"Capitec has demonstrated a concerning bias towards protecting their larger business clients at the expense of their smaller clients. I recently had an experience with my mother involving a disputed debit order from Clientele Life Incident# **********35. Despite her efforts to resolve the issue at the branch, she was unable to get Capitec to open an incident. She resorted to contacting their client care center instead. While they initially promised to investigate the matter upon receiving an affidavit, they eventually stopped responding altogether.

Despite my mother's diligent efforts in opening a ***** case and providing the required affidavit, Capitec failed to provide any feedback or escalate the issue further. To add to the frustration, their Facebook page claimed that an agent was handling the matter, but it has been nearly two months without any communication from them. In contrast, Clientele promptly informed us that Capitec confirmed a debicheck was conducted. However, Capitec has not provided any evidence to support this claim, leaving us unable to verify Clientele's stance.

It is worth noting that a debicheck typically leaves traces behind. If my mother had swiped her card, the transaction with a corresponding transaction ID would have appeared on her statement. Additionally, if she had accepted the debicheck through the app or phone, there should be evidence of such activity. Unfortunately, Capitec has not provided any of this crucial information, thereby obstructing our ability to determine the truth.

Given the lack of cooperation and transparency from Capitec, we have decided to report this issue to the banking Ombuds. We hope that they will investigate the case impartially and provide a fair resolution. It is essential that the Ombuds thoroughly examines the matter without any bias towards either party involved.",1,1,"Good day Tshimangadzo Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/15 17:53,Sylvia Van Der Vent,Capitec Unprofessional and ***********,I am at my wits end with the incompetence of Capitec. My situation is an ongoing never ending story that just seems too be getting worse. I have a 17 year old who banks with Capitec I opened the account for him and when he turned 16 the account was transferred onto his name. So my son has a very successful business and has been using his Capitec account for customer payments and supplier payments everything was going well until a month ago when a hold was placed on the account. After submitting an affidavit and proof of payments the account was released this after numerous trips too the bank and multiple phonecalls it was a relief but when my son tried too access his account he couldn't. We went bank too the bank low and behold they told us the system shows that he is a foreign national with an expired permit I was flabbergasted how the hell can someone who was born in South Africa who has a South African birth certificate and ID be a foreign national yet this account was registered and FICA'd with a South African ID. No man this is ridiculous. I then take it apon myself as the biological mother too go too Home Affairs myself and find out if something funny is going on low and behold nothing wrong at Home Affairs there system shows that he is a South African citizen so the fault is at the bank. So now with this information I go back too the bank the manager then sends an email too foreign clients department and it's been days with no reply or any feedback from the foreign client department. So today it's been a full month with nothing being resolved but just adding more fuel too the fire. The business is suffering a huge financial loss there are very late supplier payments as the account and the funds in it can't be accessed. I have a child that's in distress who's supposed too be focusing on his Grade 12 exams but has too worry about what his going too do now. As mother I am angry and as a long standing customer I am disgusted. I have paid what I am able too pay so I can relief my son's burden somehow but his main supplier is breathing down his neck for payment and I can understand that because at the end of the day this person is also running a busy and is also suffering a loss. This incompetence is causing a very bad ripple effect and I have a very good mind too sue Capitec because you guys are causing my son pain and suffering. So as a very last resort I hope that this matter can be resolved with the greatest of urgency because the bank messed up and what is happening here is not on not at all. I'm deeply disappointed as every day that passes by the deeper the financial loss becomes not even too speak about the loss of customers and suppliers. In business service delivery and reputation is everything.,1,1,"Good day SylviaThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/14 11:10,Brett E,Credit Card Headache,"Let me start off by saying, Wow..
I moved over to Capitec from Absa for simplicity purposes and it has been anything but when it comes to Credit Card applications.

I app**** for a card, upon acceptance I sent through all my documentation via Email. I was asked to re-send certain docs (that were already sent) - anyway I forwarded the requested docs through again. No response.
Follow up? No response. Another follow up? No response.
This continued for about four or five months with constant re-applying through the App and sending Emails until I decided to call in and ask why Capitec did not want my business.

The call center apologized and asked if I would be fine to take a call from them the following day to follow up. Guess what? That promise was never fulfilled either. I guess I wasted my own time during that mission, haha.

This morning, I requested a Credit Card yet again from Capitec for fun (since this is clearly a game).
Capitec attempted to called me (miraculously) on three occasions. The first two calls were abruptly cut and I thought this is just pathetic. I then decided to start the process of ordering a card from Discovery. While I was busy ordering a Discovery card, the third call from Capitec came through and I was asked if ""I WAS STILL INTERESTED"".

Side note: 
When a customer requests the use of a product from a brand, that in itself is nothing but an indication of interest. 
After mentioning that I was in the process of ordering a Credit Card from another competitor, I was met with, ""Oh okay, not a problem, bye"" - zero effort from the call center to retain a customer who has an existing account with Capitec. Creating loyal customers is one of the most important factors a brand should concentrate on. In this case however..

I myself deal with new and existing customers on a daily basis, and I would never adopt the approach Capitec has taken towards consumers. Why? In fear of losing business, which is exactly what has happened. And I'm guessing I am not the only one thus far. I will also be looking at moving to Discovery bank sometime in the future and doing away with my Capitec account considering the experience I've had.

It's 2023. Customer service is NB.

2023/06/13 20:45,Carla,Capitec service disgusting,"Capitec does not live by their motto ""Live Better"" because right now because of Capitec Bank, I'm not living better, instead I'm filled with stress and anxiety. 

2 weeks before my salary was paid into my account,  Capitec notified me that my revolving credit limit will be decreased because of my change in credit status.  I've had this credit from 2021 and have not missed one payment.  Because it's a revolving credit, I chose the shortest term to pay back because it's less interest and knowing that if I need it again,  it's revolving credit and will be available.  The shortest term means also the highest installment.  

Now Capitec has just decreased my limit and removed my credit available.  A big chunk of over R7000 was deducted. This is not helping me to live better because it's put me in financial stress, so it's actually putting me in a worst financial state because 3 debit orders were unsuccessful because of this. I have phoned in numerous times. The first person I spoke to said that my revolving credit will be reinstated.  But it wasn't.  The second person that I spoke to said that they would need to listen to the voice recording and get back to me. I've been waiting since 31 May. Still no feedback or response. They don't care. 

Looks like I have to move to another bank where my best interest is at heart and I'm valued as a customer.

When I got there I got a ticket (06) and the I got called to teller 04. I explained to him why I was there and he ask me for my payslips and my ID number.
He checked something on the computer and said he can't help me. This wasn't even 5 minutes. I asked him what is wrong, then he said I must phone Transunion.
Monday (12/06/2023) I drew a credit report Which I have from Transunion and it was clean.
Today (13/06/2023) I called Transunion and the lady assisting me said that Capitec does not use Transunion after she still assisted me and also stated that there is nothing against my name.

Why would Capitec employ someone who lie to the clients and think that the clients is stupid.
Can someone please explain why we as South Africans must keep on banking with Capitec Bank who does not have time for there customers. 

Today I also contacted Capitec Bank compliants department to lodge a complaint and they did not answer there phone. After 2 rings it redirect back to the Client Care Centre and I tried this a few times.

Just another piece of proof of how they feel about there customers.

And my question again is.

After reiterating the urgency, they dismissively repeated that they escalated the issue to the app department.

Today (12/06/2023) there has been NO further contact, and NO resolution.  UNACCEPTABLE.

I have unfortunately heard from a few different people that my personal information has been shared, and that my private life (which is no ones business) has been spreading around.

These people have gone to the same person to do their banking and she has indulged them with my personal life and information freely.

i am outraged and wish to take this further, as my personal and private life banking and otherwise should not be shared freely by her.

I will be taking this further as by law, personal and private information may not be shared with anyone (clients/family and friends)",1,1,"Good day Angelique Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/10 16:33,Rose K,Paid for Vodocom data via Capitec app but have not received data,"I am complaining about the Capitec app .I purchased Vodocom data for my second phone  on the 9th June and the amount went off my bank account but to date I have not received it.
On the 10th June I looked on Hello Peter only to find others also complaining about the same issue.
I see that their complaint reflects that they have been to the bank and that they have tried to sort out the issue but have not been successful.
I must add Capitec' s banking app service has been very bad lately. At the end of the month you have to log in 6 times in a row every time taking a selfie and changing your password and then you still cannot do banking.Which causes your debit orders not being paid in time and so that results into paying extra bank fees to your other banking accounts.I sat till the early morning hours trying to get this app to work .
They have no idea what inconvenience there app is causing the public.
I am seriously considering going over to FNB as I do not see why I should be driving  50 km to Capitec and then my problem still can not be solved.
I did not go there as I feel this could be sorted out via phone and email when they do actually read this here
Surely they can employ a more competent IT team to sort out this problem yesterdaty already",1,1,"Good day Rose Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

After I paid and received an account/statement to confirm that I am paid in full, the threatening calls started to pay my ""arrears"". I explain with every call that I am paid up and do not owe Capitec money but the consultants demand I make payment or be reported to the credit bureau as a bad payer. I then paid the R463.00 that they say I owed and it was returned to my savings account by Capitec as I overpaid! Then the threatening calls started again saying that because ""I"" reversed the payment they are going to report me to the credit bureau and I will never be able to get a loan again! This has been going on for more than a month now, every time I pay the R463.00 they transfer it back into my account. I went to my local branch at Beacon Bay in East London and was told that there is nothing they can do. I also received a message now that I have been registered as a bad payer at the credit bureau. All this because I paid my account in full, I paid every installment in time and are supposed to have a good name, instead I am now smeared black by a bank I have regarded as awesome until now. So disappointed! I have reported Capitec to the ombud for banking and will make it my mission to smear their good name black to return the favour.

I called them almost immediately and the assistant said she can't assist me since I'm not the cardholder, I was assured that the money wasn't gonna come out after I had left. So I took a taxi home and called them when I was with my dad. We were promised the money would be reversed to my dad's account by sunday in the morning. Monday morning my dad went to the branch to enquire about the issue, he was told that the money was withdrawn from the account but they will send a reference number of the complaint and a notification of the reversal and still they haven't. They cant tell is how long the issue will take to be resolved. How long will the atm people check the atm, don't they do that on a daily?

I notified them of this several times and they said the same thing.

2023/06/06 08:19,Loutjie P,Access facility closure takes 4 months,"Dear Capitec,

I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the ongoing delay in closing the access facility associated with my account. I was initially informed that this facility would be closed in March, and to my dismay, the closure date has been repeatedly postponed. I recently received a phone call from your representative last week, stating that the closure would be finalized on June 4th. However, despite these assurances, the facility remains open, and my complaint/ticket was closed prematurely.

Furthermore, I have noticed that my account still displays a balance, which I strongly believe to be an overpayment. It is imperative that you rectify this balance issue before attempting to close the account. I find it highly unacceptable that a financial institution takes a staggering four months (equivalent to a quarter of a year) to process a seemingly straightforward instruction to close an access facility that has already been paid in full. Closing complaints prematurely, merely to improve statistics, and neglecting to provide confirmation of account closure only exacerbate the frustration and dissatisfaction I am experiencing.

Additionally, I am encountering a relentless barrage of account statements on a daily basis, with some days seeing multiple statements as your system repeatedly attempts to close the account. This excessive spamming of statements is not only a nuisance but also reflects a lack of attention to detail and effective account management. I insist that you address this matter urgently to restore the necessary peace of mind and prevent further inconvenience.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to resolve these issues. Failure to do so will leave me with no choice but to escalate this matter to the appropriate regulatory bodies, such as the Ombudsman or FSB (Financial Services Board). I expect a prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this matter, including the closure of the access facility, rectification of the account balance, and cessation of excessive account statement communications.

I trust that you will treat this complaint with the seriousness it deserves and take swift action to rectify the situation. I am hopeful that we can resolve this matter amicably and avoid any further escalation.",1,1,"Good day Loutjie Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I have an issue with the Credit Rating score which is very inaccurate on your app. Based on tge credit rating and score from both Experian and Compuscan. As clearly I would not qualify for any loan products based on the incorrect scoring from your app.

Could you please update my credit score efficiently.

Today I phoned requesting a discount on the settlement the current balance reflecting on the app is R33803.28 and the discounted settlement issued as of today is R34372.39. Maybe it is me but how is it this with discount because I cannot understand how you will treat your customer in this manner.

I phoned the Capitec ***** number, but the operator said it would not help by her escalating the complaint, because is were all card and PIN transactions, implicating that I made the transactions or somebody had my card and PIN.

The pecu****ity of these transactions are that they were all for amounts less than R1000. I believe that indicates that they might have been ""tap"" transactions, which do not need a PIN. 

I immediately stopped my card and the ability to tap, and took my money out of the account.

But no further reaction from the bank.

2023/06/02 19:53,Thobile S,Manhandled by C.A.P.I security at a  Capitec ATM for standing in queue,"Dear Capitec

I am very disappointed in the manner in which a security guard conducted himself in front of my four year old child at your ATM.

Today around 14:00 I went to an ATM in PMB, I stood at an ATM queue for over ten minutes waiting and shortly thereafter a security guard came and asked me to go outside, not understanding what he was trying to tell me, I stood and looked at him, that is when he the told me that the queue starts outside, I then told him that well, I am not going outside, that is when he began to push and manhandle me in front of my child. The child was screaming and crying and the security guard said he does not care if the child is crying or not!

In my over twenty years of banking experience I have never been manhandled by a Security Guard, is this how Capitec Customers are treated by Guards?

Security Guards are often seen as kind, helpful people who are ready to protect people it serves against harm but this was not the case at your ATM.

If this continues at your ATMs it will tarnish the so very sagging reputation of this company and the fact that it was done in front of a child worries me the most.

I'm sure there are alternatives to dispute resolutions by security companies other than manhandling a woman in front of a child for standing in a queue.

I'm very disappointed!!",1,1,"Good day Thobile Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day. Kind regards Capitec Bank",2023-06-02 22:10:08

I decided to give them another chance this month and I regret it so much because once again I can't get through to their Forex department, the one time I was able to get through, the consultant didn't seem to know what he was talking about and then suddenly the call was ended, and I haven't been able to get through since.

Nobody ever called me, i sent numerous emails until Yusuf responded and said that he will get Stephanie to help me as I didn’t have a business banker assigned to me, i waited, no one called again. Then i sent another email to him to enquire if when I can expect a call, he responded to say that Stephanie said that i had already received a call and was assisted. Maybe the problem is with me i am so confused nobody has assisted me, i am trying to grow my business and i have a big order, i regret using amateurs for a business account, people who discriminate or have no time to look into people’s accounts and try and assist, very bad attitude, why did Capitec take over Mercantile bank if they are stupid and don’t want to grow the business services",1,1,"Good day PreciousThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/06/01 18:39,Dorothy B,Don't insult me with your apology. Just give decent service.,"Please don't insult me with your apology. I dont want it - just give service via your consultants. Every single person in  South Africa is suffering from PTSD, if the government lets us down, why cant you at least give decent customer service. Its not that hard. I called your call centre to ask for my online banking to be unblocked because I had entered the PIN wrong.  The first person insisted on my error code and when I told her that there was no code only a message that said I had entered the incorrect number she put down the phone. When I called back and got through to your consultant called YOLI, during her security check she asked for the last three digits of my account with you which I gave and three times she said it was wrong. I could do no more than give the correct number. Three times she said that I was wrong and she could not verify me. In my frustration, and after I displayed my displeasure she eventually asked for my ID number and after that simply announced that I had passed the security check. I asked for her surname three times and she told me outright that she would not give it to me (please check your call recording)  and cut the call. I still cannot access my online banking. I have over two hundred thousand of my rands in my accounts with your bank and whilst I have no doubt that this is merely a drop in the ocean for you and is not important, it is a big deal to me as a pensioner over the age of 73 years. I do not need or want a useless apology. If our government is useless why can the poor souls who live in this country at least, perhaps, by some stroke of luck, be a  little uplifted, by receiving decent customer service from companies who earn billions from us and live cozy lives thanks to us poor minions who use their services.  Needless to say, I will be closing down my account and moving my funds to the other biggish banks.

In the beginning of this month we were told that the documents cannot be sent from the branch but directly from the attorney's email address. The attorney never heard anything yet again and when he phoned Capitec he was informed that they didn't receive any documents nor do they have any record of any previous  incident numbers relating to this matter.

Capitec Bank has become THE MOST TERRIBLE BANK EVER!!!!!!!! They deduct money from your account for costs that who knows what for and they can't explain it. They added extra debi checks on my accoount and when i went to query, i simply got told, there's nothing capitec can do about it. I was told even if I have declined a debi check they cannot stop it. I have no clue where the debicheck came from and have never even heard of the places that put the debit order on my account yet THE BANK cannot do anything about it.

I was told sorry we cant stop it, get the creditor to cancel, which i had proof that i have in fact forwarded an email for cancellation with no response. I emailed, i called and still nothing was done. The debt mediation company was silent.  In May lo and behold the money was deducted from my account and CAPITEC still refuses to reverse the debit order. Even now i finally got confirmation they cancelled but still no response on my refund. I have emailed capitec and the standar response sorry we cant help you.

2023/05/30 16:28,Deborah M,Deeply traumatic and intelligent internal Capitec ****,"I would like to bring to the attention of the media that on 10 May 2023 I was the victim of a deeply traumatic and intelligent internal Capitec ****. My account was hacked and the perpetrators withdraw over R33 000.00 (Thirty Three Thousand Rand) from my account held with Capitec Bank. The crime was reported to the Sandton SAPS and a docket opened under case number 237/5/2023.

A summary of events pertaining to this *****ulent crime is described in detail, as below: 
On the 10 on May at 16h49 I got a call from a certain “Sandra” using the following number **********, saying they were from Capitec Head Office ***** division, and that there was a Takealot amount of R24 000.00 taking off my Capitec account. They then proceed to give me my ID number, physical address, account number, my pin number to this account, and what my last purchase had been today, which they asked me to verify, but I said no, and I told them, that I don’t trust the call and that I would call them back. Before I ended the call, they said I must please check my messages, if I don’t trust them, which I did, and there was a message saying R24000.00 Takealot order has been processed. They asked if I did get the message, which at that time I did confirm. They said they can help me to suspend my account in the meantime. 
I asked how it was possible for that amount to go off my account as I only had a balance of R13 900.00, but they said it is possible as it was an online purchase. I then decided that they should suspend the account, as I would rather be safe than sorry, and told them I would go into the bank on Thursday. Sandra then said, she can help, and I don’t need to go into the bank. She then gave me all her details to call her back. She gave me her number with an identity code number, she said this code will verify that she is an agent with Capitec Head Office ***** division.
I then ended the call, and went onto the banking app immediately, and the account had been suspended to my surprise, so decided to call Sandra back to see how she could assist. 
I called them back at 17h08 on the same number that called me at 16h49, and it was answered by a lady saying Capitec Head Office ***** division, I asked for Sandra, the lady who answered the call, asked me for Sandra’s identity code number which I gave them, and they transferred me to her. 
Sandra, then told me she can help reverse the amount, and that I must log in to my account via the banking app. We were on the phone for nearly 30 minutes, as she helped me reduce the daily limits on my account, confirmed debit orders that had come off the account, gave me information on my debit orders that still needed to be processed, confirm if I know the person (Lucky) trying to take funds out my account, helped me set up the internet banking. I also got a message to advice on new remote pin from a number ********** which was 695320, but I did not use as I was already in the banking app. 
As we were doing all the above together, I was getting verification messages in the banking app to accept or decline, by saying yes or no. It did not look out of place as this is normally what happens when in the banking app and changing settings. 
As the last verification came through to accept, R33 000.00 was taken off my account, Sandra told me not to panic, as she is here to help me, and they were in the process of reversing all the debit orders, and that it is normal, so I must stay on the line until everything is processed correctly. 
After about 5 minutes I asked what was taking so long, and she said it is because I am in the banking app and the system can’t process the funds into my account so I must log off, which I did, but then the line went dead, I tried calling back several times, but the calls went unanswered.  
When the calls went unanswered, I looked up the call centre numbers and got hold of the ***** department, and explained what has happened, they then told me that they funds had been ****** and that I must report this to the police within 48 hours. They gave me the following ref number: **********52. They also said it will take up to 21 working days to investigate and then they would let me know the outcome. 
I reported the ***** to the police on the 11th of May, and I got a case number which I sent to Capitec. Case number is CAS 237/5/2023.
What I could not understand at the time was how there was R33 000.00 in my account as I knew I only had R13 900.00 but they had disputed a number of debit orders for April 2023 to get the funds back in my account.
The debit order disputed was debit orders that go off every month, and should not have been disputed 
Capitec has failed to take any accountability, nor refund me the full sum of monies ******. This is despite my urgent and desperate escalation of the issues at hand to Capitec Bank, no such action has been taken to refund my monies by the bank. I find this grossly negligent, despicable and deeply inexcusable.

Capitec Bank Limited holds various fiduciary responsibilities including duties of care towards its clients as well as a duty of care towards members of the public, especially insofar as the management of accounts is concerned. This is particularly crucial given the scourge of *****, *******ion, crime, financially prohibited practices and organised crime in South Africa. The aforementioned duties include, but are not limited to:
A common law duty to safeguard the true owners of bank accounts and members of the public who may suffer damages as a result of the *****ulent and/or ******* misuse of bank accounts and payment systems; and
A statutory duty to ensure that bank accounts are not misused by ********s and that banks may prevent, and avoid being privy to, the commission of ******** activity, ***** and other organised crime; and
A statutory duty to protect the safety and soundness of banks by ensuring that they inter alia know precisely who the bank’s respective clients are, their sources of funds, the general usage of such funds and the transiting through the various accounts of their clients.
During the commission of the crimes, Capitec Bank Limited failed to exercise its duty of care towards me as their client in that they failed, alternatively neglected, alternatively omitted to prevent the theft of thousands of Rands from being withdrawn from my bank account. 

Furthermore, Capitec Bank Limited failed, alternatively neglected, alternatively omitted to have the necessary safeguards in place to pick up the ******* and suspicious activity of the ********s through their internal security controls and suspicious activity detection methods. Failure by Capitec Bank Limited to exercise such duty of care and failure to pay attention to detect suspicious activity has resulted in me suffering great financial loss.  
Capitec Bank Limited has failed to comply with the provisions contained in the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 38 of 2001 as they have failed to safeguard against ******** activity from taking place.
As such, I have no option but to take the following action:
I am going to report and escalate the incident to the Ombudsman for Banking Services; and
I am escalating the incident to social media and public interest platforms.
I reiterate that we have found Capitec Bank Limited to have acted in a grossly unprofessional and ******** manner, and that the bank and its employees have contributed to the worsening of an already traumatic and deeply unsettling experience for me.I do not believe that it is fair, nor that it can be accepted, that I should be plunged into a serious financial predicament due to the sheer negligence, incompetence and lack of concern shown by Capitec Bank Limited.

2. I called again still got transferred to different people and finally the person I spoke to said will have to stop my card while they do their investigation regarding the transections I know nothing about.. on top of that when I got to the branch I will be charged R70 for another card ..

2023/05/29 20:05,MW M,"Capitec Bank, worse experience ever","Terrible service and experience from experience after I suffered a loss due to being ****med. I wish Capitec Bank could just close my account after so much stress I experienced with them. It took them close to two months to come back to me with useless and information that's does add up on top of that they charge me R160 for doing jack, nothing to assist. 
Stephanie, the person who was supposedly helping and incharge of my case, charge me even after she was told there's no money to reverse from the person who owns the other account and she was found. Why charge me if tymebank tells you there's no money on their account and their line is not going though, why do a recall. On top of that you tell me it's not your fault, I did the transfer, do you think I don't know that?! Why would I let you know if it wasn't aware. 
You keep telling me about tymebank investigation and findings, and I asked for yours and she had nothing to offer, but that I must go to court. 
I think maybe ombudsman would help as I tried with Capitec Bank, but I need them to make me understand why their are trying to make money off of me without any assistance and in this ordeal. I really want to move to another bank, they are ridiculous in their investigation shem.  
Don't bother if you have a case that needs to be investigated, even when you patient and cooperating you'd still get NOTHING substantial, but rediculous explanations and charges 😡 as it is I was moving my money out of Capitec Bank because of their services.",1,1,"Good day MW Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/05/25 22:09,Serdonzito P,Low premium on customer service,"I have been a client of Capitec for a number of years now.
I recently took-up their offer of data at a very competitive price.
I subsequently bought the Simcard and loaded it with Data.
However, the telephone number allocated to the Simcard did not sit well with me, so I decided to port my number from another network to Capitec.
I subsequently called into the porting department of Capitec and enquired what the requirements are for porting your number.
I was informed that I should finish whatever airtime I had with the other network before I do the porting into Capitec.
I duly did that and started the porting some days later, after depleting my account on the other network.
However, to my dismay, my data was swiped-clean from my account.
I subsequently enquired about this development on the Customer Care Line, but was met with indifference.

How do you treat a “new” client whom had just signed unto your new service like that?

I even went into the Silverton Crossing-Branch in Pretoria to lodge a complaint, but by the time of penning this mail, I had not heard from them, which is now two weeks later.

They put a low premium on customer service.
I have not experienced such bad customer service in a long time, not even from your less sophisticated competition. 
I surmise that I got “The Middle Finger” as soon as I left the branch, because how else do they explain the disdain treatment.

I, therefore, beg the following questions; 
• “How many other customers are being subjected to similar treatment, but opt to rather not pursue the matter, 
    because they might not have the fortitude to do so?” 
• “Is it beneficial for me or any other person for that matter to continue being a client of Capitec when you are     
    subjected to this level of service? 
• “Am I perhaps being facetious in assuming that good customer service is reserved only for a select few or a 
   certain sector of the community for that matter?” 
• How does Capitec -Management operate a business when they do not offer proper customer service 
  experience compared to the other banks across the country? 
• What message do they communicate to the middle to lower-income patrons who frequent their business? 
• Whether Capitec -Management are profit-driven or service driven?

It is unfortunate that I had to proverbially; “Rock the Boat” in order to air our grievance, but I feel that I have giving Capitec Management ample opportunity to remedy this situation in the interest of fair and equitable customer service, however, there has only been total indifference. 

This issue smacks of prejudice and invariably leaves a bad taste and I am sure that anyone would agree that not a single Capitec has to endure this atrocious level of customer service. 

I believe that Capitec can ill afford such conduct, not when it strives to position itself as the preferred Retail Banking Service in South Africa. 

Furthermore, after conferring with my fellow community members, some also in the banking field and they all concur that it goes totally against the grain of what “Great Customer Service” and “Good Governance” are all about. 

I, therefore, feel that we have no other alternative but to bring this unsatisfactory conduct to the Capitec senior management’s attention and them take appropriate action to remedy the situation.",1,1,"Good day SerdonzitoThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Due to unemployment I made a claim with the insurance company and only after following up multiple times with them was my claim paid out. The claim was paid on the 17 may 2022 when the claim was submitted in March. Capitec Bank has been debitting service fees and insurance fees from said account from may 2022 till may 2023. As per the terms and conditions of the insurance policy the policy ends after a successful claim has been paid out, why has Capitec Bank kept the account active and debitting service fees and insurance fees when the credit card should have been canceled? I have not been able to use the credit facility because I would have to reapply for credit but they continued to charge these fees from my account.

I went to the Capitec Bank in Florida today to ask them to reverse a deduction that I did not authorise. I had to tell the senior manager 3 times that I am not her mama as she kept on addressing me as mama. They need to understand that their culture in their private lives is none of their clients' business. They kept on telling me what they cannot do instead of telling me what they can do. As with every other organisation, their fame eventually leads to their downfall. Their service and their professionalism has deteriorated as everything else in South Africa.

Annah, in particular, impressed me with her great professionalism and friendly demeanour. She went above and beyond to assist me with replacing my card and changing my phone banking credentials. Her expertise and willingness to help were truly commendable.

Not only did Annah efficiently handle my immediate concerns, but she also took the time to offer valuable advice on opening a business account. Her knowledge and guidance were invaluable, and I left the branch feeling confident and well informed about the steps to take.

In addition to Annah, Tsebo has also been a tremendous help to me in the past. During my most recent visit, I witnessed firsthand his dedication to customer service. He went out of his way to assist another customer in stopping their ****** bank card. The level of care and attentiveness Tsebo demonstrated showcased his commitment to the well-being of every client.

It is truly refreshing to encounter a team of individuals who take their work and clients so seriously. The professionalism and genuine concern for customers displayed by Annah and Tsebo are a testament to the outstanding service provided at this branch.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to both Annah and Tsebo, as well as the entire team at this branch. Their exceptional service, combined with their friendly and welcoming attitude, made my experience truly enjoyable. I highly recommend this branch to anyone seeking reliable banking services, as I am confident they will go above and beyond to meet your needs.

I had a loan with capitec which was paid up last month however capitec had failed to charge the service fee to the last installment. 

This month on the 25 may 2023, I was doubled charged  the service, and when i asked why i was charged the reason given was due to owing on capitec loan, but that did not make sense because capitec failed to charge the service fee last month, and then this month charged me a service fee on a service fee, that was not originally added to the last installment as it should havd been, the process by the fault of the bank however the collection persons Loreta says its no one fault. I has aksed her how is it that every month prior to the last payment the service fee was included but only in the last installmentthe fee was not included. 

I had spoken to 5 people who failed to get me to speak to a manager. I spoke a
With a lady from collections who put me on transfer to a Team leader for over 18min.

In total my calls with trying to have this query resolved is under an 1 hour with no solution, and being transfer to many departments and people with the phone ringing for more than 5 minutes at a time to just end having my call cut.

People I spoke with: 
Mbalenhle
Emalda 
Titaji
Quinton
Loreta who was suppose to transfer me to  team leader Peter mokhetsi.


Eventually the call had ended it self.

They tried 4 different machines, all said DECLINED despite money in my account. I called in the call center and they claim (listen to this !!) YOU HAVE EXCEEDED YOUR 30 SWIPES IN 30 DAYS LIMIT.

I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THIING. Upon perusing my agreement with the bank, I also see no such thing. 20 transactions a day, yes. not 30 swipes per 30 day cycle.

So, essentially, I was told to sit there until midnight when the cycle ""resets"" and I can purchase my water and fuel (thankfully the attendant didnt put the fuel in by then)

Subsequently, I have been on the phone to them non stop for 4 hrs trying to get help. They either cut me off, put me on hold for 20min, or change the story. They then tell me to log on to change my temporary limit. This also didn't work. So here i sit, 4 hrs later, unable to use my card or get fuel.

I visited this particular branch following numerous transaction between 22 - 23 May with reference ""Bill payment"" with amounts ranging 150-100 all calculated with roughly R750

The consultant insinuated that someone I know uses my account to make those transactions, which I insisted it was untrue,

She told me that nothing can be done except to open a ***** case, which might take sometime,

Am frustrated because my concerns where not considered as urgent as it should,

I trusted Capitec with my funds and the level of service received was not taken seriously,

Yesterday (23-05-2023) I called for an update and the lady said, everything is in place, I just need to wait for someone to contact me or if they require additional information. I never got the call back on Friday, which was promised, I never got the call back yesterday, so I tried calling again today. Only to be told that my application has been cancelled, by whom, nobody knows, the system apparently says I'm seeking other offers. I for one know, I never cancelled the application and without any type of notification, no email, no WhatsApp message, no phone call etc. just like that the application was cancelled by Capitec, after 2 weeks of making every effort to give them all the information they required.

I sold a car and the buyer paid (capitec to capitec) and the money reflected immediately (Saturday morning). The Buyer took the car and left. 3 hours later(12:00) Capitec puts the payment on hold and when we called the ***** division they said our query is client services issue and transferred the call to client services. Then, client Services consultant transferred us back to ***** division because it is the ***** division that put a hold on the amount. 
The story changed when we called ***** division again, they now said we now need an affidavit from the buyer who was already 200km away!! ! how the hell am I go to get that person? I had to drive 200 km to catch with up with the buyer so that I don’t loose both the money and the car. We managed to get to a branch at exactly 14:00 when they were closing, after begging the manager for help, she then assisted and said the payment will appear immediately after she sent an email to the ***** department. 
Saturday evening, the money was still on hold, we called the ***** department again, same story, they need affidavit from the buyer, show already more than ****m, plus proof payment. Why do you still need such if we’ve already gone into the bank personally? 
A visit to the Greenstone Branch Monday morning is just another run around, and it had to be escalated to the Regional manager! I mean what the hell! The experience nearly gave me a heart attach!
By the way, on Saturday, we had to hold for good 10 min before we could talk to someone @ the ***** department. Is that how it’s supposed to be?

2023/05/22 08:50,Loutjie P,Capitec refuses to close a paid up account,"Access Facility account at Capitec Bank.
 Despite closing the account in March, I have been receiving daily statements, indicating that the account remains open or stuck in a closed pending state. This persistent issue has caused significant
inconvenience and frustration on my part.

I have lodged multiple complaints regarding this matter, both through official channels and during a visit to the bank branch. Regrettably, these efforts have not yielded a resolution or provided any clarity on the situation. Furthermore, I have not received an official letter confirming the closure of the account and stating that I have no outstanding obligations. 
 It is disconcerting to note that the account also shows an outstanding amount on Transunion and does not reflect as closed on the credit report. This is highly distressing, as it not only reflects poorly on Capitec Bank's reputation as a financial institution but also has negative implications for my creditworthiness.

I strongly urge you to address this matter promptly and take the necessary steps to resolve the situation. It is imperative that the account be closed officially and all associated records be updated accordingly, both internally within Capitec Bank and with relevant credit reporting agencies such as Transunion.

I kindly request that you provide me with a comprehensive and official written statement confirming the closure of the account, as well as
the correction of any discrepancies on Transunion. Additionally, I expect a swift resolution to this matter and assurance that I will not encounter any further issues with my account in the future.

I emphasize that it is crucial for Capitec Bank to prioritize customer satisfaction and promptly resolve such issues to maintain its reputation as a trusted financial institution. I appreciate your
immediate attention to this matter and anticipate a satisfactory resolution.",1,1,"Good day Loutjie Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/05/20 05:01,Ntombi Z,Dissatisfied with the service received,"Good day 

I've very dissatisfied with the service I received from one of your branches which is located in Germiston President Street and was was assisted by Mpho Mokhele. On the 18th May 2023 I visited the branch to get assistance on reducing my access facility repayment amount by making a payment of R100 000 and also required a letter which will state my outstanding balance and new repayment amount. I took the access facility of R174 500 in 2021 and been paying monthly with no default or delay and currently had a balance of R135 000 and a monthly repayment of R5585. 00, so I explained to the consultant on what I want to do which he seemed clueless or have no knowledge of the product(access facility) which is being offered by the bank and kept on asking assistance from his colleagues which also didn't seem to have no knowledge of as well he then proceed to make calls to the BSC which he was receiving assistance and instructions on how to go about making that payment to my access facility account. I was instructed by him to open my bank account application and go to access facility and transfer the amount from my savings account to the access facility account which I did as he instructed, then there was options available before transferring the money which was following 1. Repayment 2. Ad-hoc shorten repayment amount 3. Ad-hoc lower repayment period 4. Settle account he said I must choose option 2 which read Ad-hoc shorten repayment amount and I proceed and gave a new repayment amount which will be R1360. 64 after the payment and said he instructed I must select confirm to finish the process of transferring the amount. The process was done and the money was transferred but showed my current instalment is R5585 (which was my instalment before the transferring of the R100 000) and new instalment of R1360 and I asked him why does it still shows that amount as I've already made the payment but he couldn't answer and also couldn't assist me with the letter I was looking for which states my current outstanding balance of R35000 and new instalment of R1360 which I urgently needed as I to submit it elsewhere. He made numerous calls to the client care, collections then back to client care and eventually transferred to service recovery which they said the letter can be drafted and sent to my email address within 24 hours after I have spent 3 hours trying to get assistance but no one had knowledge of what to do. After that 3 hours I spent at the branch the branch manager came by the name of Refilwe which also couldn't assist and I was still dissatisfied as to why I will still have to pay R5585 but my new repayment should be R1360 I left the branch with questions and no letter that I have required and I thought let me visit a different branch maybe I could get help and visited Germiston The Reef and was assisted by Busi which I explained to her I want a letter that shows my outstanding balance and my new instalment and also asked why will I still have to pay R5585 in the current month because I've already reduced my instalment the lady was helpful my making calls to the branch I was at before and the BSC which she was told I will receive the letter on my email address within the next 24hours. She also gave me more explanation of how the access facility works and stated that the consultant chose the wrong option when making the transfer as the option he chosen will only change my repayment amount from next month (June) not the current month and told her I can't not accept that as I have already paid R100 000 and can't paying R5585 again on my salary date. She said I must send an sms to 30679 and try to get assistance from them which I did on the following day (19th May) but also couldn't get assistance as I sent from pillar to post. I am very dissatisfied because I have been the client to the bank for 11 years and till now I have not received assistance. I urgently need the letter.",1,1,"Good day Ntombi Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I thought it was a system error. then when clicking on cards on the app, an message popped saying that I should go to the bank. No notification was sent regarding this by Capitec. I then went to the bank on Monday at the Capitec Bank Woodmead Branch, tried to explain to the guy that was helping me, but he couldn't do much but told me that he has logged a call for me, the Incident number was **********92. Then the following day I called the contact centre to follow up on this, but the lady couldn't help but said she has updated the call on her side and the person assigned to it will respond. Few seconds later, I then received an sms  stating that  the ""request has been completed and closed"" like WFT how ?? I then called again seeking clarity, then only then i was told that my account was put on hold because of the R58.90 that went into my account on the 13th May 2023. I was not expecting any money and besides i did not get any notification of this money coming into my account as it's less than R100.00. They person i spoke to advised that i should go to the police station and do an Affidavit and take it to my nearest branch. Please bear in mind that I cannot access any money from my account how should one survive in the meantime???Then today on the 19th May i went to the Police station to do an Affidavit, then I went to Killarney Mall Capitec branch to submit the docs, the lady Samukelo was assisting me and loaded everything to the portal for me and a new Incident number **********94 was generated...and then an hour later i received an sms from your pathetic ***** department saying that they need a detailed confirmation of what happened on my account...Like what more details is needed, i wrote what happened what more details does Capitec needs???? Do they want me to lie??? I  do not have the money go to the police station...why did Capitec not informing me that my account will be/is hold?? till date I have received any form of communication from Capitec, so please tell me or define customer service to me....then the *********** call centre agent was not helpful at all as she just kept quite and referred me to the complaint department, like WFT why is she there. Last year a *****ulent transaction of R4000 was done on my account, incident was **********7 I stopped the account before the funds could be withdrawn, and guess what money went out even after stopping my account....what more does Capitec needs from their customers, your service is pathetic and maybe you should just do the poor SA people and close this stupid bank",1,1,"Good day Samkelisiwe Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

But also, why suggest an increase if you cant even let me access the funds my online banking shows as available?

There are  a large amount of funds on hold on my account for purchases and EFT's made since the beginning of April.
I'm not talking about R5k... its way more. 
When I ask my banker to explain to me why this is happening... the reply is: I cant explain this because we don't know why it is happening. I was told by Capitec that 13000 clients have this same problem. Scary.
Apparently the tech/IT team is working on this... again... no feedback if I don't ask.

I have funds coming in of which portions disappears.. no one bothers to explain this to me. Surely I must be able to see a trace of where it goes. It is apparently to cover funds that was placed on hold.
If I swipe my card now and the funds gets removed out of my account and I see that it is not available anymore. How can new funds that come in be used to cover things that I already paid for?

On top of this, when I called the first time, my Banker said he would call me back in 20min time. After a whole day of calling Capitec, with my Banker not being available I was told by him when I finally reached him at the very end of the day that they had IT problems. A whole day wasted. 
The next day the same thing happened... This time at the end of the day I was told that communication could not happen for the whole day because of a power problem at Capitec head office.
Really??

I feel left in the dark, cheated and treated like an idiot.
Communication is everything.

I told my banker that this could mean that I would have to close my business doors... There was no empathy. No effort to calm me down and no real assistance.

I am disappointed beyond what I thought could be possible.",1,1,"Good day Roelf Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

They seem to not know how to assist on their end and as a result just keep hanging up. It’s not a network issue either because the one lady that was helpful spoke to and said she cannot provide the necessary information on her end and then transferred me to another department however they hung up on their end. 

I know how it works in a client care centre, when the line cuts you call back, I’ve spoken to a total of 5 consultants of which 4 hung up and non of them have bothered to call back.

2023/05/16 17:44,Wiseman M,Well done to South Africa's best bank _ Capitec,"Capitec South Africa. Is holding my account ransom as well as me and my family. My account was reported for ***** by people that I got ****med along with on an investment platform that turned out to be a ****. As well as having been ****med , Capitec blocked my account as there were reports that I was the one who had started a ponzi scheme and conned people. My account was closed by Capitec SA on the 5th of May and I and to go and submit proof that I had not ****med anyone. In that Dane week I had a funeral to attend in the Eastern Cape , Had to end up borrowing money from a loan shark in order to attend the funeral. On Wednesday the 10th of May I went to Capitec in Strand to enquire about the status of the investigation _ and the the very helpful agent named Fransciuos advised me that the account was actually opened earlier that morning _ no one told me that or notified me and then the account was closed again after the initial investigation, pending another investigation as there was another person who came to report me /my account and just like that, it was again closed. Mind you i provided Capitec with all the evidence _ even gave them statements that they never asked for , I was also de*****ed in the process _ yet they are using me as scape goat. Today 16.5.23 I went to the Kuilsriver branch to enquire and I was handed the phone to speak to the person handling  the case the case from Capitec head office Alicia Pritchard ( who sounded very nonchalant) about my case who could have not even in the least be bothered had this feedback for me ( this after she got the case file last week already and not made any contact with me ) and I paraphrase _ I could kick and scream all i wanted about my money bienh geld ransom by Capitec but I was never going to get it back unless I brought everyone of the 4 people who chose to report me as having de*****ed them _ one of them who has actually cone back to me and said that it was frustration that made him report my account. Alicia does not have any of that information or any of the previous evidence I submitted prior to having my account reopened before it was shortly closed again.

Alicia made me feel so small and so helpless and she was so cold about the whole thing basically telling me that I could forget about ever having my account reopened or getting any of the money in my account. Oh and they cannot tell me who the other people are who reported me because of popi act _ but I still need to bring their statements in order to get the account open.",1,1,"Good day WisemanThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2. I had a loan in 2017

That I haven’t paid in 3years or so to date 

I went to the pretoria van der waldt bank/branch  to check on how much is outstanding and if i can make arrangements and i was advised the below:

1. Loan is fully paid and i must contact the call center to get a paid up letter 
2. I made contact and was provided with the paid up letter immediately for the loan
3. I was asked that my credit facility has an outstanding debt of R133.00 or so and i asked the consultant to take money from my account and pay the credit facility.
4. money was taken to pay the facility and it was ‘closed’ as fully paid on the system and i must wait for a paid up letter 

I haven’t received any paid up letter for the credit facility and when i  follow up i am being told something different that my account was sold to a third party which initially i was advised that all my accounts are closed as fully paid

2023/05/15 11:51,Zizipho P,Sickened,"On the 30th of April 2023, My employer payed salaries into every employees respective bank accounts. Up on receipt of my salary I then transferred it to my sub account i.e savings plan,via the app. 5minutes later my app was not working. I then called their help line, spoke to the consultant. Consultant told me that my account got frozen due to suspicious ***** from the employer. I ask what do I need to do to get my account unfrozen. Instruction was that I should get P.O.P and affidavit from the employer,which I did get.1st of May 2023 I went the Branch submitted all the documents. The app was unfrozen but the funds were held back.Went back to the Branch again from the 4th till the  12 of May 2023 till now nothing has been done. Now my concern is how many days does it take to investigate suspected ***** because my colleagues using other Banks were sorted in one day. Its been two weeks now with no proper feedback. I had like four case numbers for this incident and clearly nothing is been done. I am sickened with this thing and already changing the bank. Even to this day my salary is being held for no good reason.",1,1,"Good day Zizipho Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

listen here carefully 
my account was stopped and a lady by the name of lizette de freitas , she closes my account and send me an email saying there was money paid from a client to me - after they realized that someone else paid her ****** money and she went to spend it online shopping - which is me - i gave her goods for the money she paid me - but mercantile bank Lizette says no my account will be closed because i the business received money from legit people BUT THEY RECEIVED MONEY FROM ****MERS - so i asked for proof of her statements or some proof stating that mercantile has a case on my account - i asked her for details or proof of what she is saying now because she was the only one calling me to say this - no correspondence from the bank or anyone for weeks- NO PROOF FROM HER TOO - so i got upset and told her she is lying to me and blocking my account on her own free will !  igot upset and she too - so i told her i was going to lay a police case on her because she wont send me anything on mercantile letter head or documents showing proof of her allegations - SHE CRIED AND SAID I WAS THREATENING HER - SHE THEN WENT TO JANNIE COETZEE - WHO WAS VERY VERY BIASED AND ACCUSATIVE - HE ACCUSED ME OF TREATING STAFF BAD BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE ""NO PROOF INCIDENT"" HE SAID  "" U INTIMIDATED AND THREATEN STAFF ""
I EXPLAINED HIM THAT I DID NOT TAKE THE FRUAD MONEY and that person who bought from me is a dealer on BINANCE - his name is REDDINGTON  - he is a usual trader and always makes orders with me - he taken ****** money and paid me with it - jannie said he dont care about that - and that person reddington IS STILL ON BINANCE WITH HIS MERCANTILE ACCOUNT - BUT MINE IS TAKEN AWAY 
HOW THE HELL CAN U implicate me when i given him goods for the money - - BUT U WONT TAQKE HIS ACCOUNT AWAY  but he taken the money from the *****ster direct ? how the hell can u do this ?
jannie tells me "" Sorry sir, they are not going to give you another chance. Employee ended up in hospital due to stress, pensioner with no income out of pocket. We are not about money only, it is about caring about our employees, elderly and the poor as well.""
so people out there - tell me is this not inside contacts ? did reddington not maybe ask jannie to close me down ?
i had 1 case only from this reddington - but had 10,000 successful transactions 
i feel this jannie and LIZETTE are biased against me and have personal vendettas against me 
MERCANTILE DID NOT EVEN SEND ME A CLOSURE LETTER - i think jannie closed the account on his own and now i want to take them up with the ombudsman",1,1,mercantile bank must explain me why did lizette not send me any proof of allegations ? why did lizette not get an investigators report send to me ? why did the person who paid me with his money NOT GET CLOSED DOWN ? but he taken money from the ? also does the bank not get clients who get angry ? is there no customer services ? does lizette not know how do deal with pressure ? did lizette really got to hospital BECAUSE I TOLD HER I AM LAYING A CASE AGAINST HER ? i have all email correspondence JANNIE NEVER WAQNTED TO KNOW MY SIDE HE JUST ACCUSED ME FROM THE GET GO ! i feel he is in contact with other traders who are my competitors i feel i was unjustly closed down by him and his allegations mercantile bank top brass must get involved here pleasexa0,2023-05-15 11:52:22

Until last night  a total of R766 without notification from Capitec telling me about this purchase and was taken from Bizmailer247.com.  I was shocked and went to the bank this morning because there was no agreements or anything I have signed up for. The bank says it hasn't left the account yet however the chat Reverse it the called a different department who was on the line over 20mins to 30mins just to tell me stop the card and make a new one which I now was charged another R70 baring in mind I just lost R766 because my bank refused to reverse this.

2023/05/15 11:26,Fatima M,Left in the dark,Capitec bank has reversed some of the *****ulent transactions that was deducted from my account but however query with reference number **********38 has just become a nightmare as there is still no solution and I was promised that an agent will call me back last week and I am still awaiting. I had to explain the entire day what happened whilst I was transacting on the day of April 25th 2023 but all I got was an evasive answer from Capitec. I have however got in touch with the banking Ombudsman and there is a waiting period and I need a final answer from Capitec bank regarding reference number **********38 to proceed laying a formal complaint as advised by the banking ombudsman. With all that being said there is absolutely no customer priority and turnaround times is non existent. I am however thankful that Capitec has investigated the previous transactions and my money was refunded to my account but R529. 00 transaction is no different from the previous ones and their system should be more securely upgraded to protect customers.,1,1,"Good day Fatima Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Hi Shabeer, if your account has a ***** stop on it. All banks are provided the right to place a stop on an account when suspected of ***** in order to mitigate the risk of money laundering and deposit ****s. 
 
Should you feel this is incorrect you can provide a branch with an affidavit from the police.
10:48 AM
hi
10:59 AM
How may we assist?
11:00 AM
i have done that and the stop was suppose to be removed - but then capitec does not investigate the account by seeing 100,000 transactions done succesfully over 4 years but only 4-5 cases - all resolved - over 4 years
11:00 AM
i am an honest trader and they looking at me like i taken ***** money from the ****mers - i only sell goods online like a normal store - these people who get paid ****** money go and spend it at shops and stores online - we - so how can we be implicated when we take nmoney from legit people who unfortunately they have taken money from wrong people - THEY SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR THEIR MISTAKES - not us the stores like shoprite and petrol stations and cafe - we cannot be liable for this
11:03 AM
Please contact our Client Care team on ********** to follow up on the matter.
11:06 AM
i have - cant come right
i have also sent emails now to complaints
waiting for feedback
11:08 AM
what i want to know is - why am i the fault ? IF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED THE ***** MONEY FIRST - THEY MUST BE RESPONSIBLE - because they take n ***** money - the bank can get a sheriff to hold their properties for the sum of the ***** - why must we the stores get the issues when we already given goods to the people who paid us - there is no way of knowing they have ****** money
we take ID and phone numbers and call the person to ask if they paying us for goods - we video call them - to make sure they are no ****mers
why must we be the one to face the music ? they must be - they have wealth to cover their mistakes

Surprisingly they keep on deducting R150.00 on my account, then i called Capitec helpline i didn't get help. Its been several times this happening. I decided to transfer all my money from main account to an acc i opened under the main account. This Technologies zaza company keep deducting on my main acc they find nothing, but my main account goes to minus, because Capitec has access to that second acc they take my money and pay. What more if this Zaza company decide to deduct R1000 ? Capitec will still take my money and pay my main negative acc. If this is how Capitec make money out of these *****ulent activities how as clients can we trust them.

I am (STILL) locked out of my business account, despite a 10 minute phone conversation with a call centre agent and completing the DocuSign verification. I also have not received my usual bank statement for April 2023 and my accountant is waiting. The bank feed does not integrate properly with Sage.

You can retrieve the recording and verify without having to go through the verbal exercise again. Email is preferred please. You will see the completed DocuSign document.  I went with Mercantile originally because I have had an excellent experience with Capitec for my personal banking over many years, but now I am starting to regret it. I was advised to stay away and go with the other blue bank for my business account. Please resolve! Once again preferably without telephone contact. I am a sound engineer and usually cannot take calls during the day as I am with clients in recording sessions.

2023/05/11 09:53,Janine J,***** claim not settled - Capitec,"I am writing this on behalf of my mother you has fallen victim to ***** on her bank account.  In the beginning of April when my mothers debit orders were due to go off, they went off and were immediately reversed and funds were then transferred to another bank account. All of this happened in one fast transaction from reversing to transferring the amount. My mother wasn't even aware what had happened until she tried to use her bank card and it was declined. Due to this happening her accounts were stopped and blocked due to non payment. This was reported to Capitec and she was told it can take up to 14 days to be investigated. 14 days came and went and no answers were provided. Come the end of April this had still not been resolved and now all her creditors were expecting to be paid a double installment. This put my mother in a serious financial predicament as her money had still not been returned and she was now expected to pay double. We are now sitting on the 11 May just to be told that they would only be able to R2600.00 as that's all that could be recovered and the balance would not be paid to her and the account it went into is empty, no surprises there. So she needs to be happy with the R2600.00 payment as it is what it is. Oh and it takes up to 14 working days to do the refund, please explain how loading and releasing a payment can take so long?

This is totally unacceptable and in my opinion not a resolution at all. The fact that someone was able to reverse her debit orders makes me think this was done by someone in the bank who would have access to do this. This is ***** and ALL the money taken out of her account should be refunded to her not just the portion they could recover. 

The best part is when they say that the money that was taken was deposited into that account and taken out immediately so they cant get it back, well honestly if someone *****s your money do you think they going to leave it in the account to be taken back? 

The worst bank to bank with and terrible customer service trying to get this matter resolved.  

If Capitec cannot resolve this, it will be taken to the ombudsman.",1,1,"Good day Janine Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/05/10 23:01,John,Capitec condoning *****!,"Hi there,
 
For the last few months, our account has been debited *****ulently for an amount of +- R279 with reference wrkt4mbuy.com.  
 
Capitec was notified about this *****ulent activity as soon as it was noticed.  After all of this time (+-8 months) and about 15 emails, nothing has been done and ***** (which Capitec is aware of) is knowingly taking place every month due to a lack of action by Capitec.  I'm confused and appalled at Capitec's nonchalant attitude in the face of such blatant *****, especially in an industry where it is so rife. Other banks that I have accounts with would have sorted this out immediately and provided the necessary refunds without the complex procedures, which we comp**** with.  Instead, Capitec chooses to ignore this ?
 
Please put an end to the *****ulent activity and provide a full refund for every month that the account was *****ulently debited, including the months before my wife noticed the *****.  Below, I provide a quick summary of events that reflects Capictec's lack of response, and in doing so (in my opinion), condoning the *****. 
 
25 Oct 22: *****ulent activity was noticed and we immediately sent an email to Capitec  email sent to  ***********
26 Oct 23: Capitec responded and requested that we send this to the forensic department. 
2 Dec 22: Sent to forensic and included all details etc instructing Capitec again to stop the debit order. 
3 Dec 22 to 26 Dec 22: Forensics failed to respond
27 Dec 22: followed up again and also provided an affidavit. 
28 Dec 22: Capitec responded with the comment ""Nothing attached"" and didn't acknowledge anything else. 
28 Dec 22: We responded and attached it again (even though it was visible to other parties copied in on the email). We urgently requested the way forward. 
28 Dec 22 - 21 April 23 (4 months later): still no response from Capitec
21 April 23: Sent another email to Capitec
24 April 2023: Capitec responded with a generic response not acknowledging any of the content in my email.
24 April 2023: I responded to Capitec, querying if they even rad the content in my email.
24 April to 10 May 2023: No response.

In conclusion, *****ulent activity was noticed on 25 Oct 22 and Capitec Bank was formally notified. It is now 6 months later and Capitec has failed to take corrective action despite the ******** activity taking place by other parties and the several emails that we sent over the course of this period. Again, I'm confused at how a banking institution can simply ignore ******** activity.  Ideally, the bank should flag this before the Client does. In this case, the client formally notified the bank, several times, yet it was simply ignored.",1,1,"Good day JohnThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/05/10 21:39,Naomi B,"Blocked my account washout communication, Fails to provide written communication so I may proceed further, payments never made into my account where also reported","Dear Capitec Customer Service,
I am writing to express my frustration and anger with regards to the recent incident involving my account. On the 3rd of May 2023, my account was put on hold without any prior notification or explanation from Capitec. After calling in to enquire about the hold, I was met with a rude agent who asked where I received my funds from. It was then revealed that my account was put on hold due to a client reporting *****ulent funds of R 18 264.10. I was instructed to write an affidavit and attach proof of how I obtained these funds.
I followed the instructions and submitted the necessary documentation to your service desk agents, who were uncertain with their work and had to call into your customer care centre for clarity. I then awaited a response which I never received and had to call in once again for a follow-up. It was then revealed that I needed to pay back the funds to the person who reported the *****ulent transaction. I had included the funds in the affidavit and attached proof of the transaction from the broker app, which showed the sender's name, surname, and payment reference. Therefore, I fail to understand why I need to return the funds of bitcoin that I sold when I will not have the bitcoin returned to my account.
It is also concerning that the same person had purchased bitcoin from me in the past with his account, and those transactions were not reported as *****ulent. I requested a letter from Capitec stating that my account was put on hold, the reasons why, the transaction amounts, and the reference so that I may send this to the broker and their legal team can assist me. However, I was denied a letter and told ""We cannot do that.""
Furthermore, on the 10th of March 2023, I went to the Bougenville branch and provided them with the incident number issued by Capitec, only to be informed that two more reports were made for the 14th of R500 and an amount over R1000. These transactions were not in my history and were never made to my account. There was no proof found or provided to account for these so-called transactions.
I am extremely disappointed with the level of service I have received from Capitec, and I need this matter to be handled as soon as possible. If Capitec refuses to assist me, I request a letter with the transaction information and payment references so that I may continue with my broker and file the matter with the courts on reported amounts that are unresisted for on my bank statements.
I look forward to hearing from you and hope for a swift resolution to this matter.
Incident number: **********93, **********44

2023/05/10 09:29,Refiloe M,I need my money please,"Hello! 
It really looks like Capitec doesn't care about it's clients. 
I have been struggling to get my funds available since they have been placed on hold in February.    I don't know what else to do because I have submitted everything that I can get and proof that what they are asking from me might not be possible.
Here is my story:
November last year I saw a post of someone selling a phone on the market place, I enquired about the phone and asked the guy to send me proof of purchase to rule out the fact that the phone was not ******, and he sent it.  The phone was still under warranty and it looks good and well taken care of too.    Go be safe I also asked the guy what if he sells me the phone and later report it as lost/****** and he suggested that we can meet at the police station for a sale and do an affidavit that state that he is selling the phone to me for R12600.  So all was good and we got to the police station, they told us that they are not allowed to be involved in those type of things but we agreed to make our own agreement on that affidavit paper. We made our agreement and we both put our ID numbers (we both had our ID's) and signed.
Later that day when I was going through the phone I noticed some odd things and send the guy a message to get clarity but my message didn't go through and I just thought maybe he will get back to me later but he didn't. 
I tried to be patient and wait for his reply but after 2 days I went to the police station to report because it was clear the guy has blocked me.  The police told me that they can't help me and I will now have to go through Small claims. I went to small claims court and got a demand letter that I must give to the guy.  On my way there I passed by Capitec Bank which is the bank I used to send money to his Capitec account, I told them the story and also gave them copies of everything I had so far.
I went to the nearest police station where he stays and aske the police to escort me to deliver the demand letter because I am a lady and I don't know what that guy will do to me if I try to deliver that alone. 
We didn't find him since he stays in a security complex, the police asked me to leave one copy with them and they will deliver it the following day early in the morning.

The following day the guy send me a message on that same number asking what the problem was and I told him to read the demand letter. 
We agreed to meet at the police station again and he took his phone and tested it. He said he wil try and pay me my money before the 14 days of the demand letter expires, and asked if he can pay in bits and I said yes.
The following day he first send me R5000 in the morning and send me R7600 in the evening.

In February I noticed that one of my savings account was missing and when I called the bank they said it was frozen due to ******* activity and I was advised to go to the bank for more information. 
When I got to the bank the guy told me the date and I quickly confirmed on our chats and I saw that R7600 they guy paid me was the *****ulent activity they were referring to.  So since then my account was unfrozen but the R7600 was missing. I have been in and out of Capitec bank and I was told to submit a certificate copy of my id and proof of payment. I told them I don't know how I am gonna get the proof of payment because the guy blocked me and I have been to the police station and they told me they can't help me because the guy paid me the money and there is no case on their side. I am so frastrated that sometimes I feel like going to where the guy stays but like I mentioned it's a security complex and  also I don't know what he will do to me, I don't think it's safe to go alone where he stays. 
Please advise me on what to do.",1,1,"Good day RefiloeThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

If you receive messages from the Bank you know that all your notifications is coming from one number but last month I realized that al of a sudden my notification SMS'es was received from 2 different numbers. I already know something is wrong and I needs to keep an eye out.

Now one of my debit orders was run with the wrong amount, RCS and why. They are a financial institution and should know better but the fact that the Bank is changing there notification number is a concern to me. Are you all in alliance which each other. I know there are a lot of old people out there which Companies are setting up as they don't check this.

I am not leaving this as RCS is charging me double as they took the wrong amount this month and they did not stay with-in our contract terms.

Now my first question is this. 

Seeing that I was asked to report this to the police, supply Capitec with all the documents, went through all the trouble getting statements, signed affidavits, getting my ID Certified and so forth ... WHY HAVENT I SEEN ANY PROGRESS SINCE THE THIRD OF MARCH ??  It has been two months???  I have been mailed by people from Capitec to tell me that they are looking into the matter but nothing more. I dont know what is going on. 
I was told by the lady who I initially reported this **** to that as soon as the money is traced I will be refunded. That very same day on the phone she told me that they can see that the money went from my account, to another Capitec, to a FNB account... Yet - I have not been refunded????   

These are the two reference numbers I have but this also doesn’t seem to be going anywhere? According to your whatsapp Chat-bot this is being handled by a specialist team... Who is this specialist team?  A bunch of Pre-School kids playing with clay ?
Reference: **********03
Reference: **********55

I have written to your ""without-any-clientcare"" department a few times. The last time was on the 18th of April and yet I have not seen anything, heard anything??
I am constantly being told that I will be contacted in due course.... When ??? 
This is a matter I would assume enjoys your most critical attention. I would also assume that these types of matters are covered by your insurance.
 
I am tired of having to follow up with Capitec. It is your responsibility to inform your clients, not the other way around.

I'm shocked at the service I got from a capitec call center agent dealing with people's money, when I asked for her names she asked me what am I going to do with her information. I  had to explain that I need it incase I want to lay a complain, however she ended up giving me her name I had to ask for her supervisor who said her name is Tracy Shikwambane she assisted me took me step by step in explaining the process. I'm not happy with the way capitec call center agents are relaxed with helping people in need of agent help they are so chilled with people's money, loyal clients I've been banking with capitec for so many years and this is the treatment I get. 

I'm so disappointed
I'm not happy with capitec I called back on the 30 
April 2023 for them to assist me they told me they will get back to me within 14 working days chance they still have to follow up with standard bank they can't reverse my money.

This however could all be forgiven until I started seeing funny R1 transactions going off over a period of two days with a reference for a Bolt account? I immediately sent these to my business banker with no response as it was late on a Friday, Saturday morning a huge amount when off with a reference for a Uber transaction!
I immediately phoned the number provided for *****e and after 30 minutes of waiting I was helped by yet another very uninterested call center agent! He basically said all that can be done is to stop the card, but he is not able and to send me a mail to confirm that this was done so that I have my proof in place!?!

2023/05/06 09:27,Mrefana Wa-MoAfrika,Horrible customer Care,"I received a credit card settlement amount in a form of a letter from Capitec, emailed to me. The following day I transferred the settlement amount from my transactional account into the credit card, using the app. Upon requesting closure of the credit card, only to be told that the account still has outstanding balance. 

First person requested that I foward the letter to him (Nolo), I did. (Big business as Capitec can't find communication sent to their client's, WEIRED I tell you).

I called back and spoke to the second advisor, she done her best to put me to the supervisor,  but with failure. (The phone dropped, but she ultimately called me back several times and still couldn't manage to get the supervisor to the line).

Then I called for the third time and spoke to Unathi, she blatantly refused to put me to the supervisor and transferred my call back into the loop. 

The fourth person answers (Simthandile), he succeeded transferring us to the the supervisor by the name of Rico or Rica. Rico/ Rica the supervisor which we struggled hearing his name, simply drops our call, couldn't even be bothered by the client's query. How is he a supervisor, how?

How is Capitec not able to see a document emailed to their client, why do I have to email to them, what they originally emailed to me? Why do I have to wait on the phone (using my airtime), waiting for the supervisor that doesn't even CARE about capitec clients. 

Does Capitec itself even care about their client's?
Why am I still owing when I paid the exact settlement amount?",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/05/06 05:38,Ellie J,Waist of Time,"02.05.2023 I have contacted Capitec Bank, to apply for one of their products. I have a savings account with them. And a Standard Bank account. Capitec contacted me and was more than 20min on the line uponthe call with all the necessaryquestionsI have advised the agent that my salary gets paid into my StandardBank and I have a savings withCapitec.
Advised documents needed so I emailed it. The correspondence was slow. Thursday I have send an e-mail to them asking what the status was. Then Capitec said I was resend all docoments in a different format because they could not open the attachments. 
I received a call from a Lady to verify with me if I have forwarded my Bank Statements. I confirmed and she asked that I must just resend it wich I did. Yesterday May 5 out of the blue I received an sms saying sorry to see you go. Following with an e-mail that (I HAVE CANCELLED) my application...... Right away I was upset with the lack of communication from Capitec Bank. So I decided to call them, just to get told that due to verification for my Employer my Salary of 3 months does not reflect on my Bank Statements. If this is the case wasting a week of my time, and the representative that called me the first time round WHY DIDN'T HE NOT ADVISE that they will not be able to assist due to my salary not going into Capitec??? I don't care if they follow a procedure. The fact giving a customer fals hope for a week long, not advising from the start! Capitec please don't bother to call me back and waist my time further more. Maybe your staff should get proper training before you employ them if so. I will definitely not vote for Capitec anymore clearly my money and business is not good enough",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I have given you my incident number so this mail is not to tell you what happened , This will merely

Tell you how poor your client-care service is and that they do not keep to dates given to clients.

This does not just incur more cost to client but a brakes trust in brand. Clients-care also puts more pressure

on branch staff and Managers as clients feeling helpless will then go to branches to vent even if the

branches cant help in the matter as they are not equipped to deal with the investigation or have

systems in place to support in speeding this up.

On the very same day at 18:00, I received a collect cash text of R1900 with ref: C**********33. I did not bother myself as I did not expect any monies. On the 20th March 2023, I received an sms from the bank requesting me to rate their services and I never visited any branch. I then decided to visit one of their branches to investigate what was going on. Besides the rude consultant and bank manager, I was informed that my account was suspended due to an immediate withdrawal via cash send done via my app on the 16th. I informed her that have not been able to access the app and last used on the 15th. Reluctantly not wanting to go further. She then logged a case ref: **********49. Till to date, I have not received any feedback. I have been to the branch o er 5 times now, I never get any help. Just excuses. The branch manager just shrugs and ignores me.

I got a reply after carefully outlining issues to my business banker and guess what he has passed the buck just as I said would happen in my previous complaint.  Not even the curtesy of reading through my mail just forward it onto the incorrect department and call it a day.  The bank is shocking, the card routinely doesn't work and does not work on Std bank POS systems, imagine running a business and you have to use your personal account when you want to top up the courier account, buy airtime, buy electricity, go through a tollgate, pay on a point of sale machine, pay for anything on payfast etc.  Imagine the hard time I have with my accountant EVERY month with having to do things through my personal account because Capitec Business do not have these services.  They promise and promise things are getting fixed but nothing happens.  It is never ending frustration with this bank please for the love of God do not open a capitec business account and go through what I have been for the last YEAR!

2023/05/02 17:17,Alexander,Mercantile Bank system UNSTABLE! No escalation process!,"Worst BUSINESS bank in SA!! First I open an account where they send me the documentation to be signed over the ""Docusign"" app via e-mail, where you click on it and then it sends a token code to your mobile number, got that all signed etc.
Then I wait almost two weeks for my bank card to be delivered ""BTW you do not even get notified that you are even going to get a card""
Secondly I call the card activation line after receiving my card, just to find out that my e-mail and mobile number (that was used successfully to open the account) are not existing on their system. Therefore I fail to answer the security questions to activate the card.
Escalated this x4 times but no one can correct it. So I get a lady's name and call in and ask to speak to this lady. She called me back and got the issue resolved in a week ""then only I could activate my card""
Now you need to call in again to activate the OTP ""Online purchase"" otherwise you can not purchase anything online!!
Different department that activates this so you must wait ""waited 2 days"" where I called them again just to find out yes it has been activated now.
Guess what!!!!! Still not getting a OTP pin to confirm purchases online, two other service providers can not get my card uploaded on their sites for automatic payments.
Called the customer care center at 086 030 925 that referred me to ********** to escalate my situation. Guess what!!!!! The call keeps dropping and when you get through they put me through to someone and then the call dies the whole time!!! Called from a Vodacom number and MTN number so it is not my line.

2023/05/01 13:23,Luke M,*********** Agents #Simon,"Good Day All,

I called into capetic bank this morning and found myself speaking to the most *********** agents ever.

They claim they don't have to help u.

I respond to her as dear and she tells me she isn't ""My Dear""

This lady is rude and ***********

She claims that under the POPIA act she doesn't need to provide her surname for us to know who we speaking too.

I can't believe that my money isn't even safe with a bank I chose to be with.

Please guys stay away from capetic they clearly are told that they don't need to help us.

I asked her who is her Key Individual as she should be working under supervision and she tells me she doesn't need too.

This is honestly shocking this lady should be fired

Disgusted with this *********** service.

I will be moving all my services over to a bank which would rather help.

I'm sadly disgusted by this for choosing capetic as my trusted bank!",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Capitec made a update on their app and now I am totally cut off from using the app as the app is only programmed to work on the wealthiest ppl's cellphones even though there is nothing wrong with my samsung JH100 they went out of your way to program their app not to work on middle class or poorer peoples phones when I use to use the app lots. 

and they charge money every time a change is made or they convince you to sign up for app usage or internet usage then end up lying and not providing what's promised effecting lifelyhoods in masses and the poorer people can't be heard cause their apps doesn't work.</div>",1,1,"Hi Jan, thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

This bank is a ****, I just lost a life changing deal because of this bank. Why should anyone use this bank because it has monthly fees and Absa on the other hand does not have monthly fees but they are more efficient, they promised to add more things on their app last year October, till today nothing. Always doing maintenance but nothing improves it just gets worse. Can't wait for Tuesday I'm moving my money to ABSA. MERCANTILE / CAPITEC BUSINESS should just close shop it's not working out it's basically a joke. Even their consultants are rude or useless. I wish I came here for reviews before choosing this bank( is it even a bank?). If you are serious about your business or you want to make a living with your business. I advise you to stay as far away as you can from this bank. You will regret!!,  If you want to be taken serious I repeat ""STAY AWAY"" , your business will collapse and you will starve. In such a competitive environment these days you can not afford to loose clients, because there are hundreds of other businesses out there who do what you do. So you need to be on your A game to stay in business.

When I checked from this lady her contact numbers on her WhatsApp business number are saying she works at Bank ***** Management. There's a white lady called MARIA STAPELBERG nickname Rita she made a payment into my Capitec Bank account to purchase products online worth 34000.00 ZAR, after I received her payment and she send me a proof of payment I also rendered the service to her immediately. Few moments later when wanted to top up my bank account I failed because it was placed on hold already. She called the Capitec Client Care and told them she made payment to my account, but I did not render the service to her, I told the bank that it is not true. I explained everything to them, and they told me I must write all that in affidavit and I must produce the receipts shows that I rendered the service to her all the proof from her and me. I submitted all those required docs to them. this happened on the 20th of March 2023 up to date they're still holding my bank account and my money when I do the follow up only to be told that this must be a civil case because this lady, she changed the story and said I rendered the service online, but she is not the one who authorized the payment.

2023/04/29 21:54,Lindo M,A disaster when it comes to integration with Accounting platforms,"As an underdog in the Retail spaces (opening a chain of hardware stores) I thought choosing another underdog of a business bank was a good revolutionary idea. It was my mistake. A terrible mistake. For many reasons but let me focus on one for now: Integration to Accounting Softwares like Xero, Sage One, QuickBooks, you name them. 

When our Accountant raised his concerns about Mercantile Bank in 2021 and the fact that our Bank was not integrating with Xero Accounting, I told him to integrate with another platform. So they chose QuickBooks. Nightmare. Later, we chose to not change a Bank, but to change to another Accounting Software, Sage One.

The problem is not the Accounting platforms, the problem is the bank itself. It's a Nightmare. I actually doubt that Mercantile Bank uses their own bank for business banking needs, because they'd know what their platform does when linked to any Accounting platform.

Lastly, the fees are too much. We do a lot of cash transactions then go to deposit at an ATM. Yhoooo the fees. We asked them for a 'package' with a blanket fees instead of pay-as-you-use just like all other banks. They don't have such a package. Messy.

Anyway, we are still Banking with Mercantile Bank with hopes that as they move to Capitec Business, they will improve into a proper Business Bank.

Now the App is blank. I can't pay staff salaries.",1,1,"Good day Lindo Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter. We have assigned your query to a designated official who will contact you within the next business day.",2023-05-02 10:37:30

2023/04/27 12:05,Cornelius,"Data doesn't expire, but it does evaporate.","It was a nice idea, but it's vapourware
After being unhappy with MTN, I grabbed onto Capitec's Sim offering with both hands. Data that never expires. One flat rate. Sign me up and port my number immediately, I said.
Sadly today is the day when I admit that at best it was a well intentioned but poorly executed project on Capitec's part - at worse it was something altogether more malevolent. The data is non existent. It really appears that regardless of where I find myself geographically or whether loadshedding is in progress, the signal is so weak and so slow that even Google Maps gives up and says ""you are not connected to the internet.""
As for the data never expiring - that much may be true, but it certainly evaporates. The reason I can say this for a fact is because I bought a second Sim card for an LTE router I use as backup for my fibre at home. I bought about a gig and put a reminder in my calendar to just do a quick speed test on there every thirty days so that the Sim card won't be cancelled if it has zero activity for 30 days. The speed test was able to download at way less than 1Mbps and not upload at all, until last time when it told me I had no data. I contacted the call centre and asked them for a statement of data used and it doesn't show me using any data, and yet the data is gone. That's it. I'm deciding between Telkom, Vodacom, and Cell C. But I'm once again having to get my number ported, but I'm not even going to try to solve this with Capitec. The product is of extremely low quality.",1,1,"Good day Cornelius Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

And strangely enough I have made transactions of that amount before, and I puzzled me to be questioned now and I suspected something is not right, I could be ****med here. Immediately after I ended the call I checked my bank app and my money was gone, and I flew to the bank within a space of 10min,got there was told ***** division stopped my account & held my funds pending investigation.

2023/04/26 16:46,Shaun P,Mercantile Bank/ Capitec Business Banking Worst Bank,"The moral of this story is... i f you have a business DO NOT USE Mercantile Bank.

The way my journey started was decent enough despite the fact that they took a few weeks to get back to me to open an account, maybe this should have been a warning to not proceed, nonetheless i did

When they introduced that they do cash backs at retailers it was a blessing and a curse in disguise due to the fact that what they don't tell you is that if you do do a cash back at the retailers recommended, they double deduct your account because their system has a lot of gremlins, The second deduction is placed on hold for a period of 14 days, last i was told, and hopefully released after but for those that process so much sales and do not recon their accounts weekly probably wont pick it up. That's only the start of the problems

I had an issue with a rental holding deposit in Nov/ Dec 2022, this they only got to be sorting out in Feb 2023, because that's how special small business people are to them and i guess their mentality is ""You need us more than we need you"".

So after numerous deposits and some sales later i got the last issue which literally threw me off the edge. They have since shoved me from call center agent to call center agent, supervisor to supervisor and now between a few managers, hopefully with the rate this is going ill be dealing with the CEO soon.

Jokes aside; this process has taken so long and the customer resolution spits out an answer which the agent just repeats, who has no understanding of what they are saying, so when question about reasonability or logical of what they saying, they like a deer in headlights and funnily enough most of the time the call gets cut( which i think is a tool they have available when they don't know anything). So i have dealt with the following people and if you ever do find yourself dealing with them be very weary and have your ducks in a row because they surely don't i.e. Capitec Business Bank Call Center staff 1. Karen Kelly 2. Marcelle Adams 3. Spenser Noel

The way the process works is that all these people phone asking for information stalling the process and just don't liaise with neither party. Calls are logged with reference numbers but no details. Who does that?

2023/04/25 14:29,lani N,Utter dismay in Capitec Connect,"CAPITEC CONNECT

So Capitec went on this mad campaign to promote their cheaper data and calls, but the connection frustrations are becoming unbearable.  What is the point of offering a service when it is SOOOOOO BAD.  The connections are very often not available and almost never when there is loadshedding.  
what a sad state of affairs we are in when you have to choose between daylight ******s vodacom or sub standard capitec connect (who I believe use MTN and Cell C towers, so  they are clearly not much better) the only good thing I can say for vodacom is at least they have the better connection.
With loadshedding being a permanent part of our lives, I have started relying on my cell data when wifi is not available to do my work, but Capitec Connect is sooooo unrealiable.  Even the agents have said: ""well don't use us then"".  Come on people - are you not even remotely interested in even trying to become better in the areas where you dismally fail????  And it's not so easy as to ""just not using you"" - I have just transferred my whole business portfolio of 10 simcards from vodacom to Capitec only to find that the promises made were hollow.  I make use of hotspot connection and the strange thing though, at the same location, one capitec sim will work during loadshedding and another not, but only for a limited time then that one stops connecting. when I switch the hotspot to the other phone, then that one works again.  Is capitec throttling maybe?
Anyway, the banking services are great, so my hopes were high for the sim connect, to my utter dismay.  Suppose the saying of better the devil you know rings true in this case.",1,1,"Good day Lani Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/25 14:09,Kabelo,Funds processed on time are not reflecting on Capitec side - Agent not able to clearly confirm that the problem is not with Capitec,"My salary for April is still not showing on my bank account and our HR department have confirmed that the payout was made on their side timeously and therefore it should be reflecting. 

After checking a few times on the App throughout the morning and at the ATM, I went to the bank to check whether there is a problem. I went to the Brackengate Branch (Brackendowns, Alberton branch) and spoke to Eugene. 

I wanted to check if there are funds showing as uncleared and to rule out the delay at the bank. All the service agent was willing to say was that I need to wait as ""it is a waiting game"" or ""an inter bank"" process, but was not willing to put this in writing so that I can have this response in writing. 

So my problem is what appears to be lack of transparency - I wanted to be clear if the problem is on the bank side or not (especially when my employer has confirmed that payment has been made on time, as has been the case for at least 16 months - I have never had this challenge).

To be told to simply wait, does not confirm where the problem is and if the delay is with the bank - why is responsibility not being taken or confirmation given? 

As things stand, the salary should be reflecting in my bank account (my employer confirmed that all is clear on their side) - why is Capitec not able to confirm that everything is clear on their side and I am simply told to wait??? 

If there is a problem, please acknowledge instead of effectively being deceptive by what is not being said? If there is no issue on the bank/Capitec side - why is Eugene not able to clearly state that the problem is not with the bank?",1,1,"Good day Kabelo Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

My naive self went and reported to a branch that I'm on medical leave due to a broken ankle. And asked for your assistance in my finances. Asked to stop debit orders, and even made arrangements with those institutions. But today, when I thought I could recover and prioritize payments I've missed for last month. To my shock, there's debit orders but when I try access my account, I can't. Tells me I have 0 balance. Of all days, when I'm in desperation. But again when I check transactions, I can see money which I can't access. I even emailed myself the statement but still can't make transfers before all monies are gone. How convenient for you and those institutions. And I bet all you gonna say and do is say ""you're sorry"" like it's gonna fix my problems. I'm sure I won't be able to pay for rent like last month, or even get my 5month old son what he needs, let alone survive on what's left after this. Your system is not functional but yet you're doing as you please. What is the point of carrying on and banking with you I ask myself? But hard lesson learned! A mistake I intend to correct by simply moving to another reliable bank. I'd rather pay for more service fees so long I can't be in control of my finances. And my posting here, don't bother calling because now I'm now ****ed as hell. All that time and effort wasted trying to do right by you. I can't have a system that's gonna stick when I could've prevented all this nonsense but access denied.

2023/04/24 10:07,Jason H,Capitec *****,"Stay away from Capitec Bank!

I have had issue after issue after issue with them and customer ""service"" simply does not exist. 

Most recent incident was regarding what would SHOULD be simple credit card replacement. 

I went in to my local branch to replace an expired CC. The 1st card they printed had all 3 CVV numbers printed on top of one another. I was expected to accept it but after pushing back, they begrudgingly cancelled it and printed another. Second card had the 1st 2 CVV numbers printed on top of one another with only the 3rd clearly visible. Not having time to to sit at the branch the entire day, I accepted it and moved on. 

When I got home, I received an sms to say that my card had been CANCELLED! I had to now go back to the branch and get ANOTHER (3rd one in 1 day) card. Unbelievable. 

Just when I thought all was good, a few days later and amount of just over R3000 went off my credit card on an online jewellery purchase. Keep in mind, I have never used the new card nor registered it ANYWHERE on any online site/s. 

Surprise-surprise an investigation needs to take place which is going on 3 weeks now with absolutely NO communication from Capitec. 
When I call THEM, I get put on hold for 20 plus minutes as they try get me feedback which they can't do. Promises that I'll get a phone-call with an update from the investigator have yet to materialise.

This is clearly an inside job as Capitec are the only ones that have access to this card and its details other than myself.

The following day on the 5th of April  I couldn't access my account, my bank account was blocked and I couldn't do transactions. On the 6th of April 2023  I went to the police station to do the affidavit that  says I joined an investment  now my card its blocked after that I went to the capitec  branch with the affidavit and my certified ID. They told me to wait for 4 hours or more so that  they can answer me but they didn't. They even gave me an incident number to track it on whatsapp, but when I tracked it they said they couldn't find any incident occurred. Then on the 11th of April  i went back  to the capitec branch  after standing  on the long que for 3 hours and I was told that I must go back to the police station to do another affidavit because the one I had doesn't have dates and the amount  of the money I deposited  and the money  I received  from Amazon investment and they said they put my account onhold because of *****. I went back to the police station  to do another affidavit only to add  those dates of the transactions, but when I came back the  capitec branch was  closed  because it was late. I just want them to give me my money in my card back then they can have their card back. I don't have cash for transport to go to the branch I spent R240 to go there just for nothing. My account was supposed to be resolved on the 18th of April but still it is still not resolved. Now at whatsapp their telling me to contact the ***** department that's how stupid is this bank. Today is the 22 of April my money is still in the account  and I can't do any transactions.

So now dmc is refusing to remove these prescribed accouts from my name and you selling the debt in in 2022 is also against my name.

I have been emailing both you and dmc and no one replies. So now im leaving this to you to fix as you messed up. 

Sold and prescribed accouts listed by both capitec and dmc i want removed immediately. From transunion, xds and all other places it may be listed
 I want prescribed letters from the lot of you on every single listed account. You have made my life hell long enough.

2023/04/21 17:08,Noneof Y,Capitec Bank gives ZERO customer service. ******* and ****mers rule it seems.,"Hi. I’m very disappointed with Capitec Bank. 21 days ago I fell victim to a Capitec *****/**** incident where money was ****** right out of my account by someone claiming to be a Capitec employee. I reported the incident to Capitec, went to the police, got a case number, gave it to Capitec, sent emails, called. Nothing. I was told to wait up to 21 days. For some reason that’s how long it would supposedly take Capitec to investigate. The transactions x 2 are right there on my statements on my account but no. They just don’t seem to want to help me get my money back at all. A friend told me that Nedbank got her money back that was ******, within 3 hours. Yet here we are… waiting for Capitec. It’s not a huge amount for some, but to me 2500 is a lot. It was MY money that I worked hard for. So Capitec allows ****mers and ******* to ***** our money? It’s permitted there? Wow. And during the 21 days nobody from Capitec contacted me at all to tell me if they were even TRYING to do their damn job. Pathetic! No service at all. I’m shocked.",1,1,"Good day Noneof Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/21 11:07,Derick ,Extremely Bad Putrid Customer Service Capitec Business Bank,"I left a reply on Capitec Bank website under business banking to open a business. call was received from Tumelo Modise. She emailed application form and supporting documentation.
Completed the application emailing back with the required supporting document on Thursday, 20 April 2023 10.50AM. Tried to call het twice but was told she is occupied most of the day. Left a message but she never called back.
This morning Friday 21 April 2023 09.00 I called her to followup on the application. Tumelo gave the excuse she is only attending to yesterdays emails this morning as she was to busy to attend to email applications yesterday. Asked why she never returned my call the excuse again she never got the message as he was to busy yesterday.
Capitec Bank is the old Mercantile Bank rebranded as Capitec Business Bank. Well I then told her I would rather then go to FNB as her customer service was putrid. If I did not gave her follwoup call then my application would never have been processed. 
Very disappointed in the ****py putrid customer service received from this person. If Capitec Business Bank does not have the time nor the decency to process my application taking a hole day then what customer support would I get if there was a problem on the account in the future?!
In short any a customers looking for a new bank for business banking stay far away from Capitec Business Bank. Don't waste your time to try and contact this bank to open a business bank. Rather go to the other traditional big 4 banks where you will get customer service and support!",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Derick can view this message.",2023-04-21 11:15:59

I visited your branch at VANDERBIJLPARK df malan today, when i walked into the branch the person at the front were facing me with her back talking to the manager at the table, i said hello twice before she turned around to assit me. I asked to see the guy at station 4, once i seated, the manger yelled from her table, do not assit him, Couple of times. I had one of my very own clients present in the branch, for capitec staff to scream at me like that not to assit me creates a bad image towards my brand that i represent, whilst i have my work uniform on!

Then on 1 April 2023 capitec did not take the debit order off my account. I called them on 3 April and asked them to please take the debit order off. They said I must just wait and they will take the debit order off my account. I kept on calling them eventually by 12 April I did a manual payment. I’m the meantime they already listed me on ITC. I then called them and a lady said I must wait for three months. She didn’t care at all. I then went into greenstone branch and there is a nice manager that is trying to help me but unable to get through the inefficiencies of his colleagues as well as the capitec red ****.

2023/04/20 14:50,Tshepo M,The inconsistencies of processes and procedures of Capitec Bank.,"I really fail to understand the systems,principles and processes of Capitec Bank especially it being a well established, growing bank.
Iv been using Capitec as my business account as I have an events company .
In 2015 a close family member asked me for my account number as he was awaiting a payment and asked if he could use my account , I gave him my account and unfortunately R20k of *****ulent funds was deposited . He used R19k and said the R1k he has left are for bank chargers as it was a withdrawal of funds and later my clients deposited money into my account as well as a friend who lives overseas . When I tried using my account I was told that it was under-investigation. Till this day. What upsets me is that money can come into the account as my old clients had this account saved as a beneficiary. I went to the branch multiple times trying to retrieve my funds with no luck. A client of mine deposited another R800 in 2016 and those funds needed to be used urgently. I went to the Capitec Maponya branch with her and the consultant who assisted me was able to take the funds out for me.What I’m failing to understand is why certain processes could be done for me to retrieve the R800 but can not be done for the balance in my account .Again on the 5th of April another R500 was deposited by my son in law for his daughters transport money as he also had this account saved as a beneficiary and I cannot access those funds .
It’s been 8 years and this is still under investigation and the account is opened.Why were funds able to come into my account after the incident and a hold not put on the account if I wasn’t supposed to be using the account anymore . Why is it still open with my money in the account . The same process that was used to retrieve the R800 is the same process that needs to be used to take out my R12k+ balance . This is really unacceptable that an entire bank has inconsistencies of processes and procedures that they follow. I need my money that is due to my because I will take this further.",1,1,"The business has replied privately, and only Tshepo M can view this message.",2023-04-20 15:05:37

Their app is a genius creation that makes banking so easy and convenient. I can manage all my accounts, transfer money, and pay bills all from the comfort of my home or on-the-go. The app's interface is user-friendly, and it's easy to navigate, even for someone who isn't tech-savvy.

In the past, there were a few bugs in the app, but after the fixes were made, everything has been running smoothly. The app is now even better than before, with new features and functionality that make it a joy to use.

But it's not just the app that makes me love Capitec. Their customer service is exceptional, and I always feel like a valued customer. Whenever I have a question or concern, their team is always available to help, and they always go above and beyond to ensure that my banking experience is seamless.

2023/04/18 19:00,Katleho,Bad Customer Service,"I think Capitec is taking this thing of digital banking too far now. They forget about the basics of customer service and retaining customers while growing their business altogether. Now they have bouncers by the door’s to make sure that customers are turned away, sent back to figure out themselves whatever assistance we might need.
I went to Greenstone Mall branch to deposit cash but I needed R100.00 change first. I went inside the branch to asked for cash change and I was told that they don’t keep cash. They could not help me and was unable to deposit the money. How do you call yourself a bank if you can only accept cash but you can’t assist with a cash change if customers need it. Since you guys are digital innovative, please install new ATMS that can accept coins and coins withdrawals, SPAR tills can do that surely SA banks can move to that direction.",1,1,"Good day KatlehoThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

On the 4th of April I got a SMS to state that Uber Eats has taken money from my account I then realized my card was ******. I called Capitec immediately they stopped the card and put me to the customer care to reverse the Uber eats amount as it wasn't me. The first lady I spoke to asked me plenty questions such as have I ever used Uber eats which obviously I had, she said i would have to pay for a new card and for the investigation if it gets rejected. I called again the following week as I haven't received feedback I spoke to a second lady which said the claim was declined because the first woman didn't fill out my questions when I wanted the first ladies name she said she can not because of the Popi act then she said no actually it was rejected as there was a duplicate claim so she gave me the second reference number she also mentioned it should of taken 48 hours and when I asked why am I not getting updates such as the first one being rejected as a result of the first lady that messed up she said it must be a system failure as I should get a SMS. I called again on the 14th I spoke to a third lady this lady told me there's still not feed back I said it's impossible she said it's not yet 7 days I said this happened on the 4th then she agreed said I should phone back that afternoon I then phoned on the 17th of April over 12 days later the 4th lady now tells me it takes 7 to 14 working days. I told her after this I am closing my account she just says she understands but that's how long it takes. I am very upset I always get horrible service yet I have been loyal since Capitec launched. 1) I havent got my money back 2) everytime I call I have to explain my card got ****** it was not a mistake of a transaction 3) all 4 ladies literally gave me different turn around times 4) I am not getting any help what so ever.

Then on 1 April 2023 capitec did not take the debit order off my account. I called them on 3 April and asked them to please take the debit order off. They said I must just wait and they will take the debit order off my account. I kept on calling them eventually by 12 April I did a manual payment. I’m the meantime they already listed me on ITC. I then called them and a lady said I must wait for three months. She didn’t care at all. I then went into greenstone branch and there is a nice manager that is trying to help me but unable to get through the inefficiencies of his colleagues as well as the capitec red ****.

2023/04/17 14:20,Dion M,Capitec Bank,"#CapitecClientCareCentre
To Michiel Le Roux the Owner of Capitec Bank. I made contact with the customer care department on the 13th April 2023 due to a mistake (Capitec Bank error - we know about the problem busy working on it)
I made a double payment on one of my accounts. I wanted to reverse one of the payments. Then they said they can't reverse the payment due to they need to check if the funds would go through to the bank which I had no doubt about it because there was still +/-R30k in the bank after the payments was made. A few seconds later ""he"" Jody the customer service consultant said that my Card has been stopped!!!! So I asked him for what reason??? Then he said o sorry wrong information. That evening we went out to do some shopping and guess what my Card does not work, tried many times, you feel like an Ass upfront the other people leaving the goods behind. 
When I reached back to Capitec again to resolve this matter, I suddenly must pay for a New Card which I did not asked for to be cancelled for No reason why. Capitec Bank 
had known that I'm working overseas because of the arrangements I made with them. 
#Jody @ Capitec Customer service department, I think you should not be in that department, reason why you don't listen to what the client's needs are. (Simple request was to reverse my money which I paid by mistake twice because of Capitec's system errors. I want this problem resolved asap. I will not pay for additional or new card because this was not my fault. Deduct the costs from Jody's salary or he must pay.

2023/04/17 13:37,Henk S,Capitec,"Hi

We have been with Capitec for over23 years and yes as  some banks sometime have problems but know it is worse

We upgrade our phones and as per Vodacom they say that there is no fault on their side it is to do with Capitec itself

We have been in and out of the bank since beginning of the month to get the bank app on my wifes new phone  when she went to the bank in Centurion mall they said that Capitec has a problem with there bank apps on any new upgrade or just new phones

We then went to another brance and with no luck not even on the customer service side when you phone all they say is that their IT is working on the program

How long will this be for we cannot go into the bank everytime we have to do transfers and the end of the month is on us but they are not sure when the App on the new sell phones will be sorted

We gave the bank our view for bad service and bad responses on our query's but nothing yet which then means i will transfer  my accounts to the other banks because we are really tired for the excuses the whole time the bank It side should have sorted this out when they started seeing that the software is going to be a problem on new phones

can we get some feedback from HO on this matter before end of the week if not we will proceed in transferring our bank account

2023/04/14 16:19,Zeb M,"Capitec Bank - Complicate banking, live poorer","There was a *****ulent transaction on my account cleared by Pormone.com which was transfered to Lifecell mobile both in Ukraine. Immediately as I noticed the *****ulent transaction I went to Capitec at Saveways Crescent where the consultant seemed to be someone who just walked into the bank that morning. After relating my story and requesteing them to stop the payment which was not not even  minutes old,she said they cannot. When I asked for reasons she could not really talk sense. She got on the phone and spoke to someone acting as a middleman between myself and the other person on the other side of the line. I asked if I cannot talk to that person so that the story can be clear she just looked at me. Thereafter she put the phone down and tried to relate what the person was saying to her and it was like she is trying to explain how she solved for X in a maths examination. Her explanation was just empty and useless. I asked why are we not contacting the ***** department,she gave me the number(**********) to contact them myself. I contacted the number thinking it is ***** department and after 5 minutes of relating my story,the consultant said hold on I am transferring your call. I would listen to voi.ce messages and irritating music then the line cuts. After few attempts and frustration one lady answered and I said to her that I dont want to speak to you but someone in ***** department and she said she can help. Its me again explaining my story and she said to me I need to tell the people in Ukraine to reverse my money. She left me wondering how quick it is for Capitec to pay international transaction but takes days to process local payments which one can go anytime into the bank and stop such transaction. As I was talking to her still stating my frustrations, then I heard "" Thanks for calling Capitec , our business hours are from 08h00 to 17h00 , Good bye"" To this minute no one from Capitec ever returned the call and to my surprise no ticket was logged for my query. At one stage I though Capitec is one of the best new banks but I can see that it was better for me to keep my money under my couch as Capitec is only concerned about their earnings.",1,1,"Good day Zeb Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/13 15:49,Sibusiso K,Credit Card Facility,"I have had a terrible bad service experience with this bank. I have a credit card with this bank, and I used the credit card to buy a car from a dealership. I did this in 2 payments made via the Capitec banking app. The first payment was for R5000 which was done on Tuesday. The next day (Wednesday) I did another transfer for R86 950 to complete the vehicle purchase. Now if you do bank transfers via the app, it does not give you an option to choose whether you want to put this payment on straight or budget facility - and I thought I would phone the client care centre and request them to put these payments together on budget over 48 months.
Indeed, I phone the client care centre with high hopes that I would be assisted. I was sent from pillar to post. I spoke to about 5 different Consultants, all of them told me it cannot be done - and the last Consultant told me only collections department can help me with my query. Indeed, I called the collections department, only to also be turned away and told it cannot be done.
Who then is supposed to help me with this simple enquiry. I thought this was simple, but I was so wrong. I have never seen such a bad service in my life. They say they are there to make the client's life easier, but they are actually making it difficult by not assisting us we need assistance.
Can somebody please assist me urgently with this simple problem...please...please...please!
Can you also at least update the app to give us an option to choose whether the payment must be on straight or budget and over how many months. Currently, there is no such option on the app.",1,1,"Good day Sibusiso Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Capitec Client Care has made me feel that way the past three weeks when dealing with then over the phone. Its not so much about the cost of each call (15-20mins) but the actual care less attitude from the staff operating the center. I hope that my frustrating 4 or 5 calls today may bring out a better response. To feel this way about your own bank after so many years is not the way i expected it to be.

I called through to the contact center to ask for help and they then transferred me to the Forex department as they said it was an international online transaction and they needed to find where the payment was. I advised them I made the payment online with my card and they still referred me to them.

I got through to a girl named Kylah Lopez in the forex department who sounded very exhausted to take a call and had me repeat myself a few times. When I explained the situation to her and how the payment was done she told me she cannot help me as it was done with my card and that she will transfer me back to the relevant department. I asked her to send a message through to the department that can help me as I am not going to wait on a call to be helped. She told me she cannot and wanted to explain why she cannot do it or help me. 

I told her I will not be doing that as just as she has to work I am taking time out of my day to get this sorted. She then gave me her details nonchalantly and told me i am more than welcome to use her details when lodging the complaint and to let her explain again. 

I told her no as she is not willing to assist and ended the call.

All I would like is to know where this transaction is as Skype has confirmed on their end it has been refunded and should be reflecting already and that you as the bank need to check on your end.

One day, I tried to withdraw some money from an ATM and was surprised to find that my card was declined. I checked my account balance on the Capitec Bank app and saw that my account had been blocked. I immediately contacted customer service to find out why my account had been blocked, but the representative was unable to provide any information and simply told me to wait for a call from the bank's ***** department.

I waited for several days without any updates or communication from the bank. I couldn't access my funds and had bills to pay, which caused a lot of stress and frustration. Eventually, I received a call from the ***** department, who accused me of suspicious activity on my account and asked me to provide additional documentation to prove my identity.

I comp**** with their request and submitted all the necessary documentation, but my account remained blocked for several more days. I was unable to access my funds or pay my bills, which caused a lot of financial strain and inconvenience.

Someone there just wakeup and decided to add two months on the term of the loan , when asked for a statement I am told it cost R45 per page, and when I asked what is the reason for the extension on the term , I am told about interest rate hike and covid19...my question is what does fixed loan mean? If you where to apply the repo rate issue,  immediately  after I acquire loan from you repo rate went down significantly and my interest rate where still the same......I think any change in the arrangement of the loan should be discussed by both parties involved,  but I was told that sms was sent, which I never received,  so my question is that you ,have my email address n cell numbers,  wasn't it important to know whether to increase my monthly installment instead of a loan term? I am trying my little best to honor my side of the deal but on the other hand you are not treating me fairly... can I have the loan statement , so I can see when did you increased the interest rate during a pandemic where people where not able to make ends meet...I must say that I am disappointed on you guys. Please investigate the matter and give me a sensible feedback as this matter will be taken further to Ombudsman...for mediation.

Every time Capitec changes my credit card, although international payments are enabled, I cannot pay my MS Office subscription.  I called the Capitec support desk, and had a range of answers. The one person told me i need an account at a different bank to pay Microsoft.  Really? I am encouraged not to pay my Office subscription at Microsoft or change banks in order to be a legal user?
And a blanket over all MICROSOFT payments- none can be done?  If this is the case. I will close all my accounts with Capitec and move my accounts.

A Nedbank client had transferred an amount of R20 000.00 on date : 4th April 2023  Tuesday. Her bank then decided to place her account on hold due to suspicious activity , this decision impacted my account as well, causing for me not to be able to access funds in my account.

The matter has since been resolved on her side but has not been resolved mine. I've attached proof of payment on email forwarded to Client Care providing the legitimacy of the transaction. 

I'd like urgent feedback on this issue as it is highly inconveniencing and straining.

2023/04/12 12:01,Malcolm H,International assistance payment *****,"For the past 3 years I have been receiving financial assistance from family in Belgium. 33 of those months capitecs service has been fast an efficient clearing my aid in days . BUT for two years running now APRIL when capitecs financial year ends my funds have dissappear without a trace. Last year it took 21 days to get my money from them they kept denying that payment had been made in the end the money surfaced when the family in desperation sent May's money to help me survive. The same as that May's money arrived all of a sudden April's money appeared out of the blue . When asked the Cape Town firex branch change their tune stating that the transaction was moved by their computer to a default folder when the bank was closed for Easter break and tht is why it was not found. This year again my funds have disappeared.i as citizen suspect that there is a worker in that branch that is committing currency ***** by buying the currency low and selling it high to fund their easter shipping bill. Because why else is the whole year perfect but every Easter funds go missing for weeks. And when we complain we are met by rude staff who tell us there is no payment pending and the problem lies with the sender not them and drop the phone. I am litterally starving to death . I have not eaten in 4 days . My electricity is almost finished . I have nearly no data or food left for my dogs . If I dint get money within days I will have to give my dogs to the SPCA as I only be able to feed them let alone myself anymore..  capitec just doesn't care. They do nothing to find the money.  The forex consultant did not even ask for the senders money transfer reference numbers or nothing which shows they di not even really look of there is money there. This month ironically is capitecs financial year end month. Maybe that is why they re too busy with bank business to care about their clients starving to death. I am disgusted and will for sure be withdrawing my funds when they decide to work an find them am closing my account I never experienced this with nedbank . 

Furthermore this and all my other complaints always result with them being vindictive and delaying the payment for the maximum 14 days to get back at me for complaining they did thst last year . This year will be no different .",1,1,"Good day Malcolm Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

The following day on the 5th of April  I couldn't access my account, my bank account was blocked and I couldn't do transactions. On the 6th of April 2023  I went to the police station to do the affidavit that  says I joined an investment  now my card its blocked after that I went to the capitec  branch with the affidavit and my certified ID. They told me to wait for 4 hours or more so that  they can answer me but they didn't. They even gave me an incident number to track it on whatsapp, but when I tracked it they said they couldn't find any incident occurred. Then on the 11th of April  i went back  to the capitec branch  after standing  on the long que for 3 hours and I was told that I must go back to the police station to do another affidavit because the one I had doesn't have dates and the amount  of the money I deposited  and the money  I received  from Amazon investment and they said they put my account onhold because of *****. I went back to the police station  to do another affidavit only to add  those dates of the transactions, but when I came back the  capitec branch was  closed  because it was late. I just want them to give me my money in my card back then they can have their card back. I don't have cash for transport to go to the branch I spent R240 to go there just for nothing.

Absolutely appalled by the service at Capitec Bank!

Capitec neglected my application of which expired this morning; I received no communication of this. I had to call in several times, only to find out that my application expired this morning of which I sent the last of the requested document on Saturday. Meaning this application could've been processed first thing this morning.

 I had to reapply of which caused another hit on my credit score. Your service has been absolutely atrocious! 

I would like to escalate this to a manger for further investigation. Absolutely appalled with the service, there has to be consequences for damaging my credit score due to lack of service!

2023/04/11 12:40,Deolan R,Incompetence with the worst service ever,"In the middle of last month, March, I have been interacted with by ****mers and fell victim to the **** until I realized that I was being ****med, the ****mers made a transaction of R58.90 to my bank account which I did send back before I realized what was going on, this was forgotten about and I moved on from the time I picked up on the ****...

On the 24th of last month I received my salary which I had access to until a day or 2 later when I tried to swipe my card to make a purchase and it declined, I went to the ATM and my balance was showing on the screen but that's as far as it went, I could not withdraw or do anything else, so I logged onto my capitec banking app to find that my account was missing, next I phoned the customer service number where they have explained to me that my account has been stopped due to *****ulent transactions, I was told that I need to go to the police station and get an affidavit and take it to the branch with my ID so I did just that, the affidavit was to say that I was unaware of the **** activity going on, I was a victim of the ****...

When I presented documents asked for in the branch, I was told that it usually takes 24-48hours and I will receive feedback, that's what the first person assisting me told me, the 2nd person said that it will take up to 3-7days depending on weekends and holidays, this was the 31st of March last month, when I was giving in the documents I also was providing my salary slip and whatsapp messages of the **** as proof but was told that it's not needed, so I have waited patiently, I haven't paid rent, never bought food, I don't have transport money for work, I'm actually walking to work and back home since, I am having a problem with my landlord and my spouse because of the situation whereby I am not getting my salary back.

On the 31st last month I did express the importance of resolving this issue and I did ask, I was told that my account may be unstopped and I can continue to use it or my account may be just opened for me to remove my salary and they will block it again and I won't be able to have an account with them with my ID number in future ever again, when she told me that, I realized that they do not value my support as a client, and they are being judgmental and drawing up conclusions before the outcome even arised and I felt very small at that point to make the decision of not dealing with capitec ever again, all I have to do is wait as I was told to, to receive my money...

A week later I called customer service again as I had received no response from capitec, I asked them to transfer me to the branch I dealt with, and they referred me to the wrong place, I asked that capitec employee to transfer me to the correct branch and he said that he cannot, I asked for a contact number for the branch and they told me that there is no number, he has no access to it, I called customer service again and was given a contact number that says ""the number I have dialed does not exist""... I continued to wait pass good Friday and the weekend...

Yesterday was the 10th of April and I have not received no feedback from Capitec whatsoever, so I called customer service again and explained to the agent exactly what was explained to me, including the 3-7 days turnaround time, and the agent then tells me that there is a backlog and it will take up to 30 days, and that's when I got furious due to not being informed correctly, however the agent did explain to me that if I do have another account, they can send my salary into the other account before resolving the stop on my capitec account because my salary has nothing to do with the incident... this new information put me at ease but at the same time I was angry to the max as this was information that was not given to me in the branch, and I've been waiting so long like a stupid for my own money...

So today morning I go to print out account details for my alternative account, I take it to the capitec branch and explain what the customer service agent explained to me and asked if she can please send my last month's salary into my other account, she then makes a call to a guy, they conversate, all in all, she gave me the same story they gave me in the beginning, she says that they cannot do that for me, she cannot call the forensics department because they don't have contact numbers like the past whereby they could be on the line with forensics and deal with something together at the same time, she scanned my account details of the new account, but she says they cannot send it, but if there is an instance where they can then they will or they will open my account just for me to take out my salary and then they will close it again, and I told her that, that's the exact same thing that they told me 2 weeks ago... no help and I was just feeling like I'm just being brushed of, I have no solid answers to my questions, she says that she will call me if she receives any feedback and there's nothing else she can do, I just have to wait...and that the system is offline, there system is always offline when you need the most help BTW...
I'm being made like a stupid back and forth to hear the same song over and over again, they tell me things to get rid of me, but can't tell me anything worthwhile or solid as they all do not know what's going on, even in the branch, the agents helping me didn't know what to do, they had to ask each other the first and 2nd time I had been their, they were lost...

I just want all you capitec users to know that throughout this experience I have learned that capitec has no customer service, employees are all not on the same level of competence, they are not on the same page, the are not fais complient, it seems to me that they are nit fit & proper all round, as I did mention to the customer service agent yesterday, to work in the bank you need minimum RE5 qualifications to be an employee in order to give financial advice however they seem to be ***********, and my next step is to reach out to the ombudsman...
I know I have made a mistake by falling victim to a ****, I am human, but this should not be the price to pay for it, being judged by your own bank as if you are a ********, and their don't care attitude to resolve our problems, I am having problems in my home now because of this because its as if i am a ****, there is high levels of stress and tension at home, my spouse and I suffer with anxiety and capitec is making everything worse and worse, and once I get my money back from them, which it seems that they don't want to give me, I will have nothing to do with them for the rest of my life, and even if I can help only just one person with this review, by refraining from falling into the same trap as me, then I did something good because to help just 1 person to not go through what I'm going through with capitec right now, then I have done a good job and a great deed in writing this review, I will spread the word about capitec to all my friends and family and I will make sure that everybody i know, knows about Capitec & I hope and pray to God that they all severe ties with this institution that renders horrific service...

I wish my rating could be zero stars because capitec does not even deserve 1 star at all... but that's how it works so...",1,1,"Good day Deolan Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/07 02:51,Mbalenhle G,Pathetic,"What an incredibly useless bank. I was a victim of *****, by a Capitec client, which I timeously reported to the police and to Capitec. I followed all procedure and was informed that it would take approximately 21 working days to close my case. Since then, I had received no updates from Capitec forensics, and was only told that their *****ster client had transferred some of the funds to another bank, when I personally followed up. They promised to contact the external bank, to make an attempt at recovering the funds. Almost 4 months later, Capitec has said and done nothing to assist me. This is particularly infuriating because had Capitec been efficient in their response, the funds could have easily been recovered, especially since it's from a client of theirs. I'm convinced that Capitec does recover these funds, but would rather not return them to their clients and use it towards their own profits. That's R16000 down the drain. And this is why ********s have a field day with Capitec clients. They shouldn't even mention that they make any attempts at assisting clients who have been victims of financial crimes, because they truly couldn't be bothered any less. And this is highly disappointing, from a bank that I've used for ages. I guess it's time to move on to better banks that actually care about their clients.",1,1,"Good day Mbalenhle Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/04 05:42,Anthony B,Capitec Bank and Easy Equities Partner,"I opened an Easy Equity investment acc on Capitecs referral as a good place to invest.
When I got retrenched I had to cash out all monies I could for obvious reasons. One of the investments had to be done through forex. This money was received by capitec.
Millions of ignored emails regarding this money were blatantly ignored by capitec. As a last ditch effort I recently once again emailed them, they informed me they returned the investment monies to the overseas bank that sent it.
Supplying me with no proof of such.
I don't have the Easy Equity app on my phone any longer so there is no way to find my money now.
Think twice before investing with capitec or a partner of theirs because you too could loose your money and it all just gets neatly swept under a carpet.",1,1,"Good day Anthony Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

What a pathetic disgrace of a system!! We used Capitec since 2014 and never experienced any problems. Since we are using Mercantile we have problems on a weekly basis. How do you lose one person in a batch transaction? How do you not  transfer the salaries of 19 people out of a batch of 86? Your system is totally unreliable.

2023/04/03 17:13,Jesse D,"Pathetic service, planning to sue if possible.","So the shiit heads at Capitec decided to block my account 2 weeks ago without even bothering to notify me about what they've done. Last week Thursday I recieved my paycheck so it seemed as if all was well and good.. However, to my embarrassment, I get hit with the ""insufficient funds"" notification when I try withdrawing cash a day later.. I go check my app, my literal account information is simply not there... I go to the nearest branch to find out what happened and an agent there tells me the account was blocked... Along with that, of course they couldn't tell me why it was blocked either.. I had to wait an hour or two to do a follow up on their useless WhatsApp platform, only to be told by SMS soon after that there was a *****ulent transaction in my account 9 months ago, for a figure of R20, that someone else sent to me. I followed all instructions and went to a policy station to get affidavits made and what not, by 10:30 Saturday morning those documents were submitted to the branch.. It is now over 48 hours later, I have missed every single one of my 7 to 10 debit orders that were due on Saturday, along with my rent that was due in the same day.. So what do I get told today when I wasted more resources and called them, ""the event is being investigated"" and that's the only update they can provide.. Whrn I came on here to log this complaint, I came to see the fact that atleast 3 other people are dealing with the same issue as we speak.. This useless bank is literally *****ing our funds for who knows what reason right now, and probably soon after this, our account will be unblocked with no real explanation... Who can advice on how this matter needs to be dealt with because I have all intention of suing them if possible based off this experience...",1,1,"Good day Jesse Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/03 12:44,Nonkululeko S,***** case,"Good day, Client care centre
I am writing to complain about the service I have received at Capitec bank. Money was transferred through a cash send system out of my account at the beginning of 03 March 2023. I didn't receive any notification but on 04 March 2023 Saturday during the day I opened my app and I realised, There is money missing. I called client services and was advised by a ***** consultant to do an affidavit and a certified copy of an ID. I did that and took it to the branch only to be told I should open a ***** case. I went to open a ***** case the police said I should at least find where the money was withdrawn so that they have information on where to start with investigations. I went back to the branch and a consultant called the transaction department who informed us she could not see where money was withdrawn. I have to keep travelling and spend money during these the trips to the police station and Capitec branch and they are far apart. My question was how is that possible because a cash send can only be withdrawn from registered merchants and Capitec ATMS. 

Then I was informed the case is being investigated, during this time I lost out on a school workshop I had to attend. I went to the branch on 31 March 2023 Friday to at least find proof that I can send to the University to indicate that there is an ongoing ***** investigation, Money was embezzled so I could not afford to go to the workshop. I was told such proof could not be generated. I have lost money and I am losing a University workshop that is critical to my studies.

I then asked the consultant about where the money was withdrawn and she called the head office and was informed at Mokopane. Why was this information not disclosed to me so that I could open a case? I further asked a consultant if I should still go and open a ***** case, she said she doesn't know Why should I even wait to go to the branch to receive information, Capitec hasn't given me any information. The consultants tell me different stories every time I go. Where is the urgency in dealing with my matter.
only when I complained this Friday 31 March 2023 on my 8th visit to the bank, after I complained about knowing anything about the status of investigations. I was given a WhatsApp number which is not very detailed and cannot be printed and used as viable proof for the University.
I am utterly disappointed in the service at Capitec, firstly by funds that were accessed in my account without my permission. Funds were withdrawn in Mokopane where I have never been. I didn't receive any notification. I have never sent a cash send of more than R300 and how can thousands be withdrawn that easily. Secondly with the consultants who seem not to have information about anything until I complain and thirdly how No one could assist with proof I needed for the workshop. 
Please note when I called on Saturday 4/04/23 I was given a reference number and when I got to the branch I was told it was invalid.
I have been visiting the branches to find out how my case is handled, I haven't been given a reference number yet. It's been a month. ",1,1,"Good day Nonkululeko Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/04/02 16:17,Johan M,"Capitec, worst bank ever","Got a big issue with Capitec Bank.  Been with them since 2012 or so.  Never had any account in the rears or late payments.  Today I went to the store and tried to buy something with my  credit card that I just had renewed.  Supersized that it declined the transaction, but there are funds available.  I thought, maybe its just the vendors card machine.  Paid with my other card.  Went to a other shop and the same happened.  Tap declined, Inserting the card declined.  Paid with the other card and it went trough.  I phoned customer service and the lady tells me that she can see that there are funds available for the transaction and that there are nothing wrong with my account.  While I'm on the line with her I try to transfer money from my credit card to my savings account on my Capitec app and it declines.  Her answer to me is that I must be in arrears with an account, not Capitec account, but something ells, because she can see that all my accounts with them are up to date, so she cant help me.  Never ever in my life was I in arrears with any of my accounts and for the first time in my life my bank accuses me of being a bad creditor.  Now I'm sitting with a good and high credit record and Capitec decided that I'm a bad creditor with no grounds.  These days they look like amateurs with there app crashing every now and then and when I went to the bank last week they could not help, because there UPS does not work, and it was not even in load shedding.  I had to use money in my savings account, that was for one of my debit orders, because my Credit card with that money in declined for no reason at all.  Tanks Capitec for giving me my first ever red flag on a debit order that are going to bounce.  I will never ever again tell anyone to move to Capitec.

So it clearly means that she used her power to get the account opened. 

Capitec enables *****sters, they claim that the document she brought was sufficient enough to open her account yet they can't take any money from her account anf reimburse me. The police refused to help me as well, but if I were to take the law unto my hands I'd get arrested for that.

I did not receive feedback for 2 weeks and 2 weeks later I was told my application was declined. I sent an email asking the reason it declined and no one is willing to respond to it.

The lady who assisted me today even told me to write to Bank Ombudsman because Capitec is so unprofessional and they won't release my money if I don't take matters to Hello Peter or Bank Ombudsman. I went to Clearwater branch today and the lady told me you guys t the top lie a lot, she showed me two incidents that were closed with no feedback, but when I check on my WhatsApp it shows ""forensic still investigating"" which is a lie, imagine your own employees losing faith in you guys and they have to del with angry customers everyday because you guys don't wanna give us food service. You have no right to hold my money, and you know it. I've spent over 400 on petrol visiting different branches..

We called the person who had sent me money and he disputed having received any money from anyone that capitec refers to as the complainant and asked them as to why they didn't take that money directly from him instead of me and they failed to answer . i would like Capitec to provide me with answers to the following questions 1. why was i not informed and had to find it the hard way when i was supposed to pay for the petrol?2. why is the senders funds not withheld but capitec jumped him and frozen my funds? 3. why would Capitec assumes that the money that i was sent was from the victim's account since the person who sent me money has always money in his account? 4. is Capitec going to reimburse me for the unnecessary costs incurred while trying to sort this out, the petrol i wasted going to branches, the airtime i wasted calling and compensate me for the embarrassment i suffered at the garage? i really feel like my rights were infringed as i am a client and i pay for the services that capitec renders to me. i would like to take this matter forward to the court if i do not receive satisfactory answers and i will also close my account.",1,1,"Good day Emmanuel Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I then rushed to the bank as I also received a sms to say my money is in. at the branch they told me they stopped it because of the R38 and because off the account it has been paid in to and then advised me to go and get an Avi davit with all proof off what happened and proof of payment to show the money in the bank is mine. I did all that went in the next day to the bank to submit my things. they told me that I would be updated and given a grace period to access my funds and I understood as I just wanted to get my cash flow out. week past by no answer after that I submitted again the next Monday running into 2 weeks now. oh and don't forget the airtime I waisted about 10 times on a help line that didn't help at all speaking to agents that don't seem to know what they are doing. we running in to week 3 still no feed back I've been on the phone yesterday for 2hours being thrown from agent to agent and non of them seem able to help me and even sed that they cant contact there own ***** department that is investigating my case but why are they in vreking space or something according to them they can only email. lol what a joke.

2023/03/28 12:42,Lindiwe M,undesirable practice,Unhappy with the service rendered from Capitec jabulani branch. ref escalations **********65- On the 20th March 2023 I visited capitec branch jabulani and was assisted by Zama for a vehicle finance application for a business venture.  Application was done processed and approved for R180k-I advised Zama that I am going to shop around and come back to finalise as I am shopping around for a vehicle- with the approval I went to an auction and paid R5000.00 deposit and bid a vehicle which is non-refundable-I called Zama on sunday afternoon as she had provided me her cell number and advised her that I want to conclude our deal and she said I should come in and do so. 27-03-2023 7 days later I go in and she tells me my application has been (declined) when I asked Zama why has my application declined she told me not all my debit orders were reflecting at the time of the application on the 20th March -I had provided Zama 3 months bank statement as requested all the debit orders where reflecting nothing changed from 20th March to 27th March with regards to my expenses. I told her that she has cost me R5000.00 with false hope and she just said she is sorry.  I then contacted the branch and requested to speak to the manager Bulelwa and told her the whole story she advised that she will look into this and come back to me. later after 5pm she called back and told me that Zama told her that at the time she captured the application my debit orders where not reflecting (3 months bank statement provided reflecting all my debit order). They say my vehicle finance and home loan and tracker where not captured. these are my main debits ( how did she not capture these) why did she not advise me as per my expenses confirmation that she is not including these debit order.  I was given false hope and made decisions and arrangements in my condition (pregnant and dealing chronic high blood pressure). only to come back and be told my debit orders where all not captured. How is this my fault as a client banking with capited that your consultant did not do the right thing. Today Bulelwa calls me and tells me the very same thing - she even told me that she will train all the staff going forward to consider client pay day and debit orders and I asked her will she be training her staff at my expenses when they where suppose to have been trained before I even sat and did the application. I trusted that who ever is assisting me they know what they are doing. I further asked her that if i took the loan on the 20th of march they would have given me a loan I do not qualify for? without proper debit order checks? It is not fair for me to loose R5000.00 because a staff could not do the right thing. this has caused me so much stress.,1,1,"Good day Lindiwe Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I went to a branch and the consultant was unable to help me. When I asked her what now, how do I transact in future, she said I have to use self service inside a branch, meaning every time I have to make a payment or transfer money etc, I have to visit a branch, I cannot use the app and I cannot use internet banking as you need the app for that.

This morning I accidentally transferred R2260 into my credit card account, instead of R260. I have been handed over by Capitec due to not paying my debt at Capitec ,therefore I wanted to start contributing R260 towards my credit card from this month ,but as mentioned above ,I made an mistake by paying in R2260. I went into the branch at Bougainville for assistance, the consultant was very friendly that assisted me and phoned the CCS department on my behalf for a refund ,but I was told that I need to send an email to CCS and wait 5 business days for feedback. I urgently need that refund as that was my rent money. I can not wait 5 business days ,it was an accident. I am human. It happens. Why can they not just reverse the payment? Take R260 ,and refund me with the R2000?Please assist. I need a refund urgently.

2023/03/28 08:52,Sylvester R,Suspended capitec bank account number with incident number **********01,"Suspended account number with incident number **********01

My name is Mokgoma Sylvester Rashalaha id number :********** 083. I am a capitec bank customer account number. Please guys at the forensics investigation department do your work. Please do what you are paid for. This is concerning my suspended bank account. I have done all that you have required in order to reinstate my account but my account is still closed.

You closed my account on the 21st of march 2023 due to instruction that you have received from standard bank after I have received money to the value of R160 000 form standard bank client. Yesterday 28th of march 2023 I went to standard bank with the person who deposited the money into my capitec bank account. It was found that when payment was made from standard bank to my account a call was made to the standard bank client he failed to answer the call to conform the amount. Yesterday when I went to the standard bank Modimolle branch with a standard bank client everything was cleared on his site and standard bank issued an instruction in the form of email to you guys at capitec bank to reinstate my account. But to my surprise you at capitec bank you are not responding to instruction from standard bank by reinstating my account.

From today I have more than ten debit orders that must go through my account which are as follows: 2 vehicles debit order, medical aid , vehicle insurance, life covers, funeral covers and investments. If these debit orders are not paid they are going to lapse and there will be serious consequences.

 

Your cooperation on this matter will be highly appreciated.

2023/03/27 17:13,Basetsana C,Suspecting fraud,"If there was an option of rating zero, I will rate Capitec bank zero.
My account is blocked, the bank says I received money fraudulantly.
I have been receiving more money last year many times but the bank didn't block my account so out of the blue my account is frozen since last Friday.
This bank must be sued due to lost funds when buying airtime calling customer service, using petrol to visit branches that are claiming to be offline.
This is ****.
I went to Brits mall branch, they gave me a reference number with no answer that why is my account blocked, claiming that it will work within few hours.
After few hours I called customer care now they tell me that they suspect fraud, I received money on fraud, I must submit affidavit, proof of payment and certified ID copy, this is ****. Don't they have my copy of ID?
What about my debit orders?
What about my commitments?
Can't pay my bills and will be held liable of interests due to late payments.
Spent The whole weekend with no access to money.
This bank is scamming people's money it should be closed, after 10 years using the same bank and receiving a lumpsum of money into my account they now suspect  fraud.
We are spending our money and time to fix unnecessary issues. Now have to que for affidavit at a police station with poor service.
Shut down capitec bank, After this case I am moving to another bank.
This is so stressing, have to travel to Brits branch as Lethlabile branch is offline.

(2) I've tried to email Capitec about 15 times. Got so far as to choose which option of branch i would like my family to pick up the new card. But still, that's where the contact ended. (3) If I get told to use the WhatsApp line ONE more time from the customer care number. I am going to lose it!

The person knew all my wifes details including her banking details and pin number which my wife did not confirm was correct.
She asked her to go into her app and check.
Suddenly whats app messages appeared and vanished
She told my wife its fraudulent activity she is trying to stop.
When a beneficiary notice came up she took a picture and closed the app.
She immediately phoned capitec and after some wait got through and asked them to close the account immediately.
She went to the police station immediately to report the incident.
She sent Capitec an email and read tracking showed it was read almost immediately.
32 hours later she received a response.
A few days later she phoned to check on progress they said they had not received the documents.
My wife sent them proof.
She was told the investigation will take 14 to 21 days
On 14th day she phoned them same runaround.
This is what they did and almost a joke !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What they did was reversed her paid debit orders paid 21 days before. YES REVERSED AFTER 21 DAYS !!!!!!
The fraudster created a VIP premier account and transferred the full R 16700 stop order amounts from the savings account to this Fraudulent one.
We had no immediate support from the bank if the acted immediately only around R 2000 would have been lost.
After their so called investigation they sent my wife a shoddy report and basically say its not their problem.
This left us with cancelled insurance and medical aid due to non payment and not one of them queried the non payment. 
Where do we go now ??

2023/03/25 14:23,Sisa,Capitec is robbing me of my money,"My account was blocked in 2018 and capitec bank claimed that there were fraudulent activities happening on my bank account which I told them that there was none. Anyways my account was never unblocked and that didn't really bother me as Capitec was not my main bank, it was my secondary bank. Recently my brother deposited funds into my account by mistake and I was told to provide both an affidavit and proof of payment from my brother which I did to access the funds. Now I'm told that the bank cannot release these funds. They can only release it, if it was a salary or UIF deposited into my account. 

Has anyone had a similar problem, how did you resolve it?",1,1,"Good day Sisa Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/25 11:14,donda,capitec atms and customer handling,"First of all let me say I actually like banking with Capitec. However there are a few things I would like for them to address. 
1. the atm's at Ziyabuya complex open a bit late and shut a bit late. the atms open around 8pm, I use a taxi to get to work and at times I need cash but can't access. and by the time I return from work around 6pm the shutters have already come down. this does not make sense to us as customers since other shops are still operational till around 7pm. People now are starting to vandalize your shutters to access or deposit money. Clearly this shows a lack of customer responsibility on your part that customers must resort to such antics. I was at Kenako an customers joined in and held the shutters up after 6pm due needing to do transaction. I suggest you open your atms around 5am and at close at 9pm. These are complexes  and they are guarded. 
2. why is it that you go at 9am to change the atm money vault...why cant that be earlier and not interrupt business.
3. ziyabuya has only two atm and this caters for kwadwesi, kwamagxaki, klein school, slovo, ext...zwide veeplaas and a lot of informal settlement residents. this is why you have 50+ users in a line daily. you need to open another atm around this area cause the customer capacity is overwhelming.
4. Do you do surveys with your customers cause this a easily remedible situation.
5. and a cash send facility that can send to the others banking brands from capitec would be an idea. and you can charge a bit extra for the service. I want my incentive for this idea.

Think outside the box...capitec. I waited close to two hours just use the atm today",1,1,"Good day Donda Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/25 09:36,Daniel M,Mercantile bank genius idea to change thier name,I opened up a Healthcare practice a month ago. I decided to go with mercantile bank since capetic has given me good service in the past. What a dangerous assumption I made. First off it took me 3 weeks to open as a sole prop because of the terrible service. Now that I can live with. It cost me 700 rand in courier fees to send my banking details to the relevant medical aids. This bank now decides to change its name 1 month later and now I have to update my banking info with all these medical aids again because capetic decided to be spontaneous. What kind of professional organization does this when they have loads of clients who run businesses that need to keep thier banking details accurate. How many people will this create headaches for. Don't go with this bank. You will regret it. I'll be changing banks thank you very much.,1,1,"Good dayThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

It raises eyebrows to the public we're meant to get great service but we're told to dispute with the service provider (Clientele) to cancel, why?

My account has been blocked since Tuesday, no communication as to why it was blocked had to call in and find that an external bank has flagged a transaction coming in as suspicious, since the call I’ve been taken from pillar to post trying to have my account sorted out.

Went into the branch today to submit the relevant documents to have the block lifted, called in after a two hours as advised by the branch consultant only to find out that the documents submitted were not submitted to the fraud department, I can’t emphasis enough how unprofessional and incompetent that is.

I still sent the documents AGAIN, regardless of the many days I had to wait for this matter to be resolved, I still need to wait a furthermore 24 - 48 WORKING HOURS to have access to MY Money.

The external bank assured that the email to lift the block was sent and I can agree because I had the same issue with my other account but the block was lifted promptly without me jumping through hoops.",1,1,"Good day FumaneThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I advised that if the 25th fall on a weekend I get paid the next working day  , I was advise this would be escalated so that the necessary changes can occur . I have been looking at my App and it still says the debit will go off on the 24th  . Today I received an sms informing me that my installment  will be collected earlier ? Why hasn't my payment date not changed and will Capitec reimburse the R150 returned debit fee my bank charges for the debit order that will bounce ?

I informed the bank of the changes yet no change has been made , please make arrangements for the R150 reimbur*****t as this will be caused by negligence in your customer service department",1,1,"Good day WendyThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/21 14:37,Elriek S,NO NOTICE / POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Good day. 

Today, the 21st of March I wanted to visit my Capitec Branch to get my Capitec Sim card as it is a very good product. 

To my surprise, when I got there, the branch was closed. Note I visited Capitec Branch, Kalahari Mall, Upington. 

I look very carefully: There were NO NOTICE that says they are closed on a public holiday. Nothing. Only the standard trading hours. 

So my question is, how must the public know that the branch is closed on a public holiday if there is no notice that spesifically says they are closed on a holiday? 

I think this is very poor communication and also very poor customer service to say the least. I thought a well established bank like Capitec Bank would inform their clients and also potensial clients that they are closed on public holidays.

I will be waiting on your call.

This morning I wanted to find out if my local Capitec branch, Campus Square in Melville, would be open.  I called the bank's client care line and opted for WhatsApp channel assistance. 
The exchange went as follow:
Hi there MAGDALENA
Welcome to our simpler way to get the answers you're looking for (complete with smiley face emoji)
Tap the Main Menu button below .
I did this, but there was no option covering my question, so I posed my, I would have thought, simple question:  Is the Capitec Branch in Melville Campus Square open, to which I received the following reply:
Welcome to our simpler way to get the answer's you're looking for (+ You've guessed it;  SMILEY FACE EMOJI!), followed by Tap the Main Menu button below, etc..
To which I replied:
My question is not covered in the Main Menu.  Please let me know if Capitec Campus Square Melville is open today.
To which I received the following reply:
Welcome to our simpler way, bla, bla, bla... 
To be clear;  I realised from the outset that I was dealing with a bot.  What I did not foresee was that it would be such a spectacularly poorly programmed one.  
This has not only been a waste of time; it is an insult to and a waste of my goodwill as a Capitec client.

Its been almost two months and one has come back to me. I've been sending emails on the feedback nothing.

I think I need to change banks, when one applies for credit they run to give it to you, but they fail to help their customers yet they claim that they  care. I don't think they care for their customers 😕 

It is only through this platform one will receive attention from this bank, because this is happening to me for the second time. And am tired of sorry, we expect professionalism from you that's all.

What is most concerning is that, it is only Capitec that is seeming to pick this bogus ‘under administration’ status up, as I have logged into my TransUnion profile and there are zero defaults / judgements / debt review / administration flags whatsoever on my report. 

My wife is 7 months pregnant and the funds we paid into the credit card account was specifically in order to pay for everything regarding preparing for the baby and the birth  (as we don’t have medical aid) ..

I started with R2000 & the ATM rejected R300 So it made a R1700 deposit & I added the the rejected amount to a R5000 so it was a total of R5300. The ATM again rejected R80 this time, depositing R5220. in the process of writing a reference, I wrote my name, surname & contact details but couldn't confirm due to load shedding, the ATM shutdown. I went inside Khayelitsha Makhaza 07(Capitec Branch) & reported the matter. the consultant informed me that it takes 24hrs to get a response, but got it 55 minutes later & it was still load shedding at time. It stated that my dispute has been declined there were additional funds found it the ATM. Who took it then? Are there no cameras at ATM's? Does it take 55 minutes to investigate such?
By the time of the response the bank was closed, So I went again on the 15th of March 2023 to the bank to query about the response I got in the ref of **********47. So the claim was declined, as cash taken & the case was closed in 55 minutes. This time was being assited by Zenzo Danisa who kept on referring to Nombuyiselo Mlambo the Bank Branch Manager. They both concluded an email to Complaint Management. I went again today 16 March 2023, there is still no response.

I am still reiterating what I said in my Review dated 16 Feb 2023, 12H19. I am still annoyed by your incompetence on handling my loan repayment. I cannot be frustrated just because I opted to shift my salary to a more capable Bank than you. I have received confirmation from my bank that just like in February, you have managed to debit your full Loan Repayment Amount of R4785.96 yesterday on 15 March 2023 (My Payday). 

I still fail to understand what gives you the audacity of sending me your stupid SMS this morning at 06H47, reading thus: ""Capitec: MISS DISEMELO, your failure to pay R4, 785.96 arrears was noted and will affect your access to credit. Call us now to solve this. **********"".

I am warning you to stop threatening and harassing me while your money is sitting in your Bank. Should this persists in the following month, I will definitely write to the Bank Ombudsman to help me get you off my back. In addition I will never stop exposing you on social media platforms accessible to me. 

As per my Review on 22 Feb 2023 and email to one of your so-called Complaints managers, I am not working for you. I will not risk losing my job or perform my duties poorly by entertaining your meaningless telephone calls. I am not available (period) for you Capitec on my phone. As stated to you, I suffered a great deal in 2022 due to a Fraudulent Transaction made on my Makro RCS Account, which landed me in hospital on numerous accounts and took almost a year to clear my name. Therefore, I do not answer any suspicious calls.

As mentioned to you before, the nature of my profession and responsibilities do not allow me to entertain you or any other incompetent Service Provider that I do not owe anything. Hence I took it upon myself to seek assistance at your useless Eastgate Branch to update my debit order details.

I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS YOUR ISSUE REALLY, I MEAN TO:
(1) DEBIT MY ACCOUNT ON MY SALARY DATE/ PAYDAY AS AGREED.
(2) STOP YOUR STUPID AUTOMATED THREATING MESSAGES.
(3) STOP HARASSING ME ON MY CELLPHONE, I WILL NOT TAKE YOUR CALLS.

It's been 3 weeks since I submitted the report and I'm being thrown from pillar to post now that they have to pay and at time being disrespected by the capitec consultants.

I deposited a princely sum of R 400 via the cardless mechanism at their ATM. The machine closed after I had made the tranaction without any confirmation of the deposit. After going through many avenues, I am still left very frustrated. I was informed that the matter would take between a day or two working days to be resolved. The person who was receiving the deposit into their account is in dire need of the money as they need to feed the family tonight. The call centre agents at the Capitec toll free number do not know a thing about customer centricity.  Also, I kept hanging on for a considerable amount of time being banded from post to post. I am utterly disgusted. I have no doubt that the Board of Directors and their staff will at least enjoy a very hearty meal this evening. Kindly enjoy your meal, remembering that it is your customers who are paying your salaries and in so, have provided the very meal that you and your families will be gorging on.

(I confirmed with an employee from Capitec and they confirmed that it was indeed now with NBA). Anyway I made payments till last month when I settled the account. I was given a discount on the said loan and paid it fully. Amount that was initially outstanding was R30 500.00 and got a discount to pay R24 400.00 of which I paid in full. I was the issued with a settlement letter for this, I sent it to Transunion for the Judgement to be rescinded since it was confirmed I no longer owe anything and my account was even closed by NBA. To my surprise I received a reply from Transunion that the creditor is saying the account wasn't paid in full so they cant remove the judgement from my name. Like where am I supposed to go from here?

2023/03/13 12:52,RENTHIA B,Bad experience,"It was a sunny Monday morning when I woke up to an alarming text message from my bank. It read: ""Your account has been blocked due to suspicious activity. Please contact us immediately."" I felt a knot in my stomach as I realized that I wouldn't be able to access my funds until the issue was resolved.

I called the bank's customer service line and waited on hold for what felt like ages. When I finally spoke to a representative, they told me that there had been several unauthorized transactions on my account over the weekend. They couldn't give me any more details, but assured me that they were investigating the matter and that my account would remain blocked until further notice.

I was frustrated and worried. I had bills to pay and no access to my money. I asked if there was anything I could do to speed up the investigation, but the representative just told me to wait and that they would contact me when they had more information.

Days turned into weeks, and still, I heard nothing from the bank. I called them almost every day, but each time I spoke to a different representative who had no knowledge of my case. I was bounced from department to department, and no one seemed to be able to give me a straight answer.

Finally, after nearly a month of being blocked, I received a letter in the mail from the bank. It stated that they had concluded their investigation and had determined that the unauthorized transactions had been the result of a phishing scam. They had refunded the money to my account, but it would remain blocked until I changed my login information and took additional security measures.

I was relieved to have my money back, but I was also angry at the bank for taking so long to resolve the issue. It had caused me a lot of stress and inconvenience, and I felt like they could have done more to keep me informed throughout the process. I ultimately decided to switch to a different bank that had better customer service and security features.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Yesterday the restaurant that hosted the event did it not take money out of my account? The restaurant is First15 Brewhouse located in Newtown Johannesburg. When i query with the bank they're telling me that the transaction date was the 19th of November and the posting date was the 6th of this month but when i swiped at the restaurant the transaction was successful and the waiter was even chatting to us after i paid. Duku-duku when i check my statements there is no transaction as to where my money went on that 19th, when i as them where did the money go because only money in appears on the statements so what about money out? dololo. I am not getting any straight answer. What is this? They keep on saying my account was on a negative that time every month i always have money on my account and i never had any missing money. Imagine a restaurant billing you again 4months later and yet you paid them. I mean what restaurant would even let you leave without paying na? And if they say i didn't pay how did they get hold of my card details because i went there once and i paid!  They don't want to reverse my money because I'm telling them mna i don't even know what that was for and even the owner of the restaurant says it doesn't appear on their accounts that they took money out of my account so what is so difficult for capitec to reverse my money when even the restaurant says it doesn't appear on their statement. Even on my statement there is nothing that tells me who took the money. So who must account if not the bank? Because they're suppose to be accountable for every transaction coming in and going out of the account. How can a transaction that happened not be on my statement? Where is my money?

They get persistent and phone from different numbers. It ended up in situation where I had to hear the same old story of how we stole their land and other vulgar comments, unprovoked. How did these people get this level of personal information if they did not work with it, or know someone that does?

I’ve paid off/settled some of my loans but they are still showing as outstanding. I’m 100% sure i paid the exact amounts i was advised of, i even have the settlement letters and smss to confirm the amount. Instead of your agents assisting me they are trying to dispute what i tell them and argue with me. This might even end up in the ombudsman should you guys fail to assist me. Please look into the matter, you can also have someone to contact me, and it should be someone who will be able to assist me in clearing whatever outstanding amounts that are showing on my settled loans. Your agents are not competent. Sorry to say this but come on, i know you can do better and I’m giving you guys an opportunity to redeem yourselves and help me out.",1,1,"Good day Lifa Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/10 09:00,Brilaine M,"EXCELLENCE- CAPITEC, ATLANTIS","It is with the greatest pleasure that I write this review as a Capitec client. 

I visited the Atlantis branch on 6 February 2023 and was assisted by Mr Wayne Owies. 

Mr Owies was attentive and professional. He listened as I enquired and showed a level of knowledge of the bank's products which I can only salute.  Being somewhat new I had several questions to which he patiently explained until I was satisfied. He went above and beyond to share his understanding of the bank's products best suited to my needs. 

While assisting me he simultaneously delegated tasks to staff to the strategy around the loadshedding schedule and had communicated this to the clients in the ATM line. 

I was impressed by the ease and confidence Mr Owies demonstrated throughout the process. I must also mention the respect the staff displayed towards Mr Owies and him to them, in return- the process took a little longer than expected but the staff was the epitome of ""leave no man behind"" as they ended the workday together.  

I left feeling beyond satisfied with the service received.  

Once again, to Mr Owies and the staff at Capitec, Atlantis- outstanding service. 

Thank you and well done!",5,1,"Good day BrilaineThank you for taking time to acknowledge great service, it makes our jobs worthwhile. Kind regardsCapitec Bank",2023-03-10 12:28:30

2023/03/09 22:21,Mandisa S,Poor Client Experience - Capitec Branch Ghandi Square,"So around this date in February 2023 I logged a complaint for the Capitec bank in Ghandi Square regarding denying their clients access to use the Atm because the branch closes at 17:30 regardless of the fact that the client joined the queue before the closing time (17:30) - well clearly my complaint fell on to deaf ears, nothing has changed and no plan has been put on place. A very unfriendly Sfiso from the branch literally closed the ATM door and told people to go to another branch not even considering from what time these people have been standing-very disrespectful. So if this branch is not serving its purpose then why not close down permanently so that other dedicated employees within the same vicinity can assist clients, clearly they don't know the meaning of a service profit chain and they dont have their clients best interest at heart",1,1,"Good day Mandisa Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

When I call them to request for a prescription letter they are telling me that the account is not prescribed which is not the case.

Save yourself a lot of trouble and deal with Capitec only! I have had an account with them for 8 years and never had an issue at all.

2023/03/07 13:03,Marshall M,Horrible Capitec Bank service,"I have the horrible experience with Capitec Bank!

They put my account on hold the 15th of December 2022. This was due to my account being reported for a deposit scam. I made my way to the bank to find out what the issue was, and what documents I require. I submitted my affidavit and ID copy certified as requested. It has been 4 months to date and all I get as a response is that they will SMS me. I AM STILL WAITING and I have been calling in to the bank going in physically. The same Generic response from them is it that the fraud department will contact me. I have 15K on hold, this was my December bonus and I was for the entire festive season without money. There is no remorse from this bank whatsoever! I am utterly disgusted by their service and how they go about doing things.",1,1,"Good day Marshall Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/07 11:29,Petrus J,PAYMENT DATE AFTER MORE THAN 1 YEAR NOT SOLVE.,"From Yesterday until today, I make 84 calls to the Capitec head office without success. My daughter took a personal loan out more than 1 Year ago. We asked the Bank to take the installment off on a Saturday because she gets weekly pay, and the Bank takes off the money on a Friday. Nobody at Capitec Bank can solve this problem. Is this due to incompetent personnel or what? The Branch of Capitec in Vanderbijlpark ask my daughter again for her payslips then they will solve it, but still they can not solve it. Then they asked my daughter for a letter from her employer that stated that she is a permanent employee and we gave the letter to the Bank and still, they can not fix it, now after 1 Year later the problem is still not solved.",1,1,"Good day PetrusThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Your online banking i.e. the App and internet banking is falling apart! I am unable to login to Internet banking - with the QR code or the token. Nothing works. This is a daily occurrence now. I am unable to download the Sept 2022 credit card statement via the App, again nothing works. I am just receiving that stupid message that says you are aware of the problem...

2023/03/07 10:52,JJ M,Where is my money that was taken with scan to pay?,"I used to love Capitec Bank. But I'm having more and more problems with Capitec and they are fast becoming worse and worse.

Last week Thursday I paid for a breakfast at Wimpy. I forgot my wallet so I opted to pay with the Capitec scan to pay option on the Capitec app. 

The payment slip showed ""pending"". And I was told that if showing pending the payment was not through. I scanned again and same was shown in the card machine. ""Pending"".

They gave me one of the employee's phone number that was linked to their Capitec account and I transferred the payment to them. 

They said that the other two payments that was pending would be reversed by Capitec within a day.  I waited one day but no reverse happened. On Friday I went to Capitec and they assured me that the payments was not outstanding or pending and that it did went through to Wimpy.

And that if I wanted to reverse these payments I will need the two slips from Wimpy that stated pending. But it would take a few days and a fee to reverse the payments.

I went back to Wimpy and they said they would investigate. They only could provide me with one slip. 

They showed me their cash up slips for Thursday and there wasn't any corresponding payments that went through.

The manager of Wimpy then took my statement and their cash up printout to Capitec bank herself. They told her that if I wanted that two payments reversed had to do it on the same day only.

Now I have no idea what to do. According to my bank statement I paid three times for one R102 breakfast. 
So for big guns like Capitec R200 is nothing. But for me it means a few days electricity or fuel, or milk and bread  

So the money isn't in my account anymore and it also isn't at Wimpy. 

Where is my money then now?
Must I just let it go?

It is not right. And how many times dies this happen. And somewhere someone gets that money as it cannot just disappear into thin air.

It's 5 days now and my money is gone. No reverse happened. 

I do not exactly know who is at fault here as Wimpy provided me with proof that the money didn't get to them, however Capitec couldn't provide me with an answer of where my money is now.

I must also note that Wimpy employees were very helpful and really made an effort to assist me. 

They even want to make a collection between all the workers to pay me back my missing money, but it is not right because they are not at fault, and someone or something must have that money. It cannot just disappear. 

Only thing I know for sure is that it isn't in my Capitec account anymore.",1,1,"Good day JJThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/07 09:31,SP H,CAPITEC MAFIA BANK,"Capitec is one of the worst Bank  Guys. SARB/Prudential Regulatory needs to intervene. My money was stolen early January to find the Betway account.Went from pillar to post to get the matter resolved and possibly the refund. I was told that i compromised my pin. I let it go and opened account with standard bank and switched the debit orders to standard bank including the of capitec. Went to capitec and give them banking details of standard bank to take their monthly debit order for a loan. Come pay,  i deposited money into capitec bank for other debit order whose debit order were not switched over. I told one of the lady at Capitec Branch that they should deduct their money, they said the will. they didn't and it was towards month end the money was exhausted in my account. The account was in arears and attracted interest. Went to the bank last 2/March 2023 and asked, why is it difficult to deduct, They checked their system and the standard bank reflected as my new banking details -they called head office- they said the debit order will be deducted on monday,06/03/2023. Yesterday around pass 17:00 received a call that my account is in arears and must go to the bank? so why this ups and down? is it because i am no longer banking with them they are just frustrating me? what needs to be done if you have captured my banking details but you are unable to deduct so that i can intentionally remain behind with instalments and ultimately bad credit record.",1,1,"Good day SPThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/07 08:58,Nico,"Capitec, fast thieves!","This complaint follows on a previous one, see below. 

After my previous complaint, Capitec sent me a message here on Hello Peter. Basically saying they tried to call me and could not get hold of me so I had to respond within 24h or the complaint will be marked as resolved.... Wow! How is that for service! Your KPIs must look really nice! Resolved all within 24h! You know you can search my cell number on your system so get my email address? 

If you read my response you would have read that I have emigrated, I'm on a different time line and you will not get hold me on my cell, I will not give you my new cell number and you can respond per email. But I guess this complain will be treated as the one before....


Original complaint:
I had long term investments with Capitec that I had to cancel due to cash flow issues. Capitec’s cancellation fee was the reversal of ALL the interest on each investment FROM INCEPTION! Now you cant discuss it with the clerk you are dealing with as they are none the wiser and have no authority to change it. I took Capitec to the Ombudsman which said they cannot do anything about it. The cherry on top was that Capitec confirmed that I am still liable for the tax on the interest to SARS even though I did not receive a cent from them. 

Take your money to another bank and make sure you get in writing what the cancellation fees are!",1,1,"Good day NicoThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/06 18:20,Anico J,Deceiving and refuse to help costumers that were deceived,"Never purchase any data from capitec for MTN numbers, which shows #GB + #GB Monthly (for example 2GB + 2GB Monthly) as they are trying to deceive their costumers.

In some or other magic way costumers are suppose to guesse that half of their purchase can only be used between 00:00 and 05:00. This way of advertising is deceiving and causes customers to waste their money on something they are unable to use and lose money they needed. They refuse recharges and refunds and refuse to listen to their costumer's issue.
They refuse to help you on Capitec and MTN side. They just say that you were suppose to know this before purchasing, which is impossible to know before purchasing as it isn't stated anywhere.

I was deceived into purchasing this bundle, which I am unable to use half of it.",1,1,"The reviewer has replied privately, and only Capitec Bank can view this message.",2023-03-06 18:24:08

2023/03/06 08:09,Kate M,Poor service at customer care,"Am writing this review on behalf of my mom who is a pensioner, yesterday she wanted to withdraw money around 18h30 at a cash express machine and after the atm said the transaction was approved the ATM shut down due to power failure but she got an sms that the money is withdrawn, I called the call centre and they said we must wait for an hour for reversal..still today the money is not there

I tried to do a conference call for my mom since she didn't have airtime and she is worried about her money..okay the bank doesn't do conf calls...fine..then I tried to transfer her still they can't assist her

I bought my mom airtime, she called the bank but the person that was assisting her didn't want my mom to put the phone on the speaker mind you my mom has a hearing problem and she uses speaker all the time ...my mom said she was struggling to hear the agent since she was told not to put her own phone on speaker ! we are not even sure if someone is attending to her query because she is unable to give feedback on what the agent said because she could hardly hear her

So the bank now decides how we should use our cellphones!

Another lady was saying that we should go to the branch..I mean which money are we going to use to go to the bank!

Is this how pensioners are treated at capitec bank.

My mom doesn't even have a reference number for her call and we not sure how long is it going to take to get her money reversed if it's going to be reversed!",1,1,"Good day Kate Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/05 09:30,Gabriel,False advertising - Compulsory credit insurance for credit card account,"I applied for credit card online and then requested a call back to finalise the application. When the consultant phoned and I enquired about the costs, she told me I need to take out credit insurance balance protection as it is compulsory. Alternatively, I need to provide them with proof of any current credit insurance policy i already have with another service provider. This is absolute non-sense. No other bank makes it compulsory except African Bank. Furthermore, nowhere on the Capitec website or brochures does it say you need compulsory credit insurance. In fact, it only says for term loans that this is a requirement. This is false advertising so be careful of Capitec as all their products have catches which is not disclosed even in their T&Cs. Will also be reporting this to Advertising Regulatory Board.",1,1,"Good day GabrielThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/04 13:33,John,Capitec : Deliberately misleading clients with Connect offering and missing funds that are not accounted for.,"The Review that follows was submitted and received a ""confidential"" response from Capitec. How convenient. In a nutshell their consultant admitted in a recorded telephone call that the bank's Connect service has no connectivity greater than LTE as per my complaint. I have since tested said connectivity extensively and nowhere! does Capitec have anything above the outdated and barely functional LTE connectivity. In their confidential response they , rather astonishingly continued to deny their misleading campaign and went further with the lie by claiming to have 5G connectivity. As for the missing money they gave it back to me but have still not explained where the funds went and why a minimum balance was not in the account earning interest. With over 6 million clients this amounts to 155 Million ZAR that is earning interest in an unknown place and the expropriated funds appear nowhere on any client statements... It's a little disappointing to see the bank use this ""confidentiality""excuse and unilaterally shut off the revelations about their Connectivity lies and missing funds. Has HelloPeter lost it's effectivity by allowing this... Here is the original submission...
Capitec Connect Advertises cellular services that it does not provide. Capitec also deducts undisclosed fees and hides these amounts which do not appear on statements. Their Connect advertising promises a lot but they neglect to mention that their connectivity is limited to the outdated LTE. Their R5 SIM cost is accompanied by a R25  fee that is not mentioned upfront but more curiously it is not disclosed by the bank-staff or on its statements. What could amount to around 155MR is earning money for Capitec but what was this sneaky deduction and where is the money? In the mean time I will try get my Apps to work on false promises.",1,1,"Good day JohnThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/04 11:56,Maryke,"Capitec customer service is non existent,  not that I expect you would care ro respond","Unfortunately 0 stars is not an option. I am frustrated and annoyed. Firstly I called today as I had a unauthorised transaction going through on my CREDIT CARD. Another one went through the day after(19th 20th of Feb) Note  that once I saw the first transaction I called to log it as unauthorised. After the second transaction I again called. Your consultant Zizi in the fraud department was amazed the first consultant did not adviseme to stop my card immediately. While talking I did that. She again logged the transaction. She handled the claim (I think). So after going through transactions and screenshots and and.on the 28th a agreement was reached to fix (debit) my account with the unauthorised  amount. Which was done. Up to now extremely efficient, barring the first consultant not informing me to stop my card. 2 days later after this was then escalated to Mastercard ect. The merchant refunded me. While I was in the bank Capitec reversed the debit, as I was informed would happend. I was going to as Johanatahn to call to do that. I asloasked the purpose of the digital/virtual card and he explain that people use it for these tye of transaction as its easier to stop and replace at no cost. Yes I paid R70 to replace my CC for a merchant doing an illegal transaction onmy account( I still need to understand that as it is not a customer fault). Moving on while sitting on my bed today, Capitec did another reversal. Now undertand my transaction was dealt with through the fraud department, so I chose option 2 fraud realted, a very rude lady did not even listen to my query said I am in the wrong fepartment and transfered me to customer service. I spoke to rose. Explaining my story again. She said yes this is the reversal because the merchant refunded me. I then asked her ro stop and listen to me again. I explained again that there is now two charge backs not just one. She then asked for your pin access to my account. Which I did. She said she is in so when I started explaining the transaction step for step the line went dead. I was on the phone for 8min 39 sec. I waited no call back. So I called picked option 1 customer service. Got thru to another consultant, explained everythinh again and then she asked for access. She kept saying there is no transaction. FYI. She told me the same story about the debit and credit. I know this as It was explain probably 4 times maybe 5 when I reported the unauthorised transaction. She kept saying she doesnot see the transaction on my statement. I said I am looking at my balance and I know my credit is x having x left after the transaction and the still not understanding replacement fee for my card going thru it should be y. Its now z. Then she realised the transaction is on my credit card got that info and stated she can shee the two reversals. But I need to speak to credit department. And ask them ti call me back URGRNTLY. I didnt but patiently explain that this is the 4th person I am telling this to. Went through the whole process with Boitumelo. She agreed to everything I explained. But I am at COLLECTIONS and she can't  help. So I then grinding my teeth an bitting my tongue to not start screaming, in a very firm voice told her she is not going to put me through she wil take downmy number, started giving my number she interupts me to say she has all my details,okay then take this to her supervisor and tell him to call the credit department supervisor for him to get one of his agents to call me back I was on the call now for 29 mins. She interupted me then explain that she can do that but she can not guarantee he will get hold of that person. I SAID i dont care. She then interipted me again, saying  she explain she she is in collections and she cant help now I am shouting at her. I said then very firmly that she is with a customer and she is inyerupting me while I am talking and that is not acceptable to do so as I am the customer. I explained irrespective of where she is working she still represents Capitec and irrespective of which idiot( first bad word I used in this entire time) put me through to her, she needs to do what I am requesting, which was not unreasonable at this point I think we were at 40mins now approximately. I then said I am finished and she can now speak. She said she will do as I asked and if there is anything else she can help with. Upon which I said no good bye and ended the call. So not going to go into everything that went wrong here. You can decide for yourself as Capitec what you deem acceptable,but for me THIS is NOT ACCEPTABLE ( please note I am not shouting but just stating my feeling very firmly) so if you wish to keep me as an active client. I suggest you do something here. O and FYI I still have not received my URGRNT call back. Guess customers are not important at all....yes I am sarcastic now.",1,1,"Good day MarykeThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

If there are numerous complaints about a ""business""/ scammers that are debiting customers accounts without consent surely your fraud department should do something about this.

I have 2 unauthorized debit orders from Diversity Life (REF: SS-Dvesity) that went through my account which I'm unable to reverse.

I have never been in contact with these scammers prior to them debiting my account nor have I ever agreed to anything binding with them. 
Where is the mandate for the debicheck? 

I would like money returned, Capitec as a bank is really failing, banking with you is high a risk.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/03/03 13:46,Willie J,My Capitec account deduction problem,"For a long time now I was struggling with deduction going off from my bank account!
YES, deductions I did not approve or even subscribed to. 

I went to a Capitec branch and spoke to a consultant who explained to me that they can either cancel my card or I can set my online purchase limit to R0.00. But if I cancell my card there will still me fees allocated to me. So the only way was for me to set my online purchase limit to R0.00

Recently I discovered that there are fees that you pay for for every deduction that was not successful. Mine calculated for over R400.00

Today I decided enough is enough!! I am going to cancell my account at Capitec and move to another bank if this situation is not resolved.

I called Capitec and raise my concern. The consultant who assisted me was so nice. So kind and very helpful! She explained to me that if I cancell my card there won't be any fees allocated to me because the card won't exist no more. I will still be able to do cardless transactions untill I can go to a branch to get a new card.

Tarryn, thank you so so much for you excellent service! Thank you for the kind person you are! I was not having a good day at work and then this deductions made it even worse. But you gave me hope for Capitec Bank. You made my day!

Capitec should give you a raise and if they don't then the CAPITEC BRANCH DO NOT DESERVE YOU!!! 

Capitec, please see to it that Tarryn gets everything she deserves. You should hold on to this employee because employees like her are hard to come by.

2023/03/03 12:34,Bridget E,Disgusted in the service of capitec Nad Centriq insurance,"Disgusted
I am very dissatisfied with the service rendered by capitec bank. I submitted a claim on the 11 February 2023 for my deceased brother. When I asked the consultant on the phone whether there is any proforma police report from the bank that needs to be completed she siad no I must get a police report from the police. Which I did and submitted. I went into the bluff branch to check on the status of my claim only to be told that I need a police report completed on the bank proforma which the consultant printed out. I then got it completed and submitted it on the 14 February 2023. I was then told I need an inquest report which is impossible to obtain so early in the case. I then asked the Investigating Officer in the matter to write a letter in this regard which she did and I submitted. Still I have not been paid out. My mother made a claim for the exact same deceased with documents and was paid out her claim. Why is there inconsistencies and double standards. I had to go as far as borrowing money in order for my brother to be buried because Capitec has now become the ones that decide how people will die yet we take out policies knowing that if a family member passes away you have peace of mind as you have a policy. I am really dissatisfied. The nerve of going as far as telling me that my mother claim was paid in error. This been no error of the claimant but instead of the claims department which I don't see as an error as premiums were paid on time for in the event of death the claim been paid out. All I can say is this whole funeral policies with its clauses is all a scam not to pay beneficiaries. Longer standing insurance companies pay out beneficiaries without any hassles only capitec comes with issues.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I can see now on my side yes, So what you also need to take into consideration is there needs to be a R25 in the account to keep the account active as well. So it shows on my side that the balance is correct as it is showing on your statement."" Which had nothing to do with my query.

2023/03/02 08:39,Rouxle R,EXTREMELY POOR CLIENT CARE CONCERNING AN ELDERLY MAN,"My grandfather was robbed of his bank card on 09/02/2023 at the Capitec Meyerton ATM. He had already inserted his card and pin number when he was overpowered by a bravo male who then proceeded to withdraw the money before running away. My grandfather is nearly 80 years old, so he was obviously targeted. 
 
He ran into the bank to stop his card immediately, but by the time a consultant became available, R5000 had already been withdrawn, and another R5000 voucher was bought at Pick ‘n Pay (So R10 000 in total). Capitec assured him that they would fully refund him for the outstanding R5k because it happened at the bank, he stopped the card immediately, and there was no security on the premises. 
We got an email stating that the claim has been denied because the original pin was used for the transaction. This, was after he was assured that it would not be an issue, because he followed protocol. Stopped the card within minutes, reported the case, went to the police station for a case number, and then back to the bank as he was instructed. 

I sent an email on 15/02, then again on 27/02, and placed numerous calls, including one on the 27th. It is now nearly a month later, no one has even bothered to contact us. This is utterly disgusting behavior and a lack of client care. An elderly man's livelihood has been taken from him, and Capitec could not be bothered in the slightest to even communicate with us.

I was unemployed from April 2023 however I started struggling payment towards my account only June and prior to that all was well. Now that I’m employed, I had planned to pay off my arrears by 03 March 2023 and then continue with my normal payments but I am appalled by the fact the bank put the whole account in arrears! This was even confirmed by nimble when I contacted them to get clarity. Even with my credit card, I have paid off my arrears but the R0 balance is still reflecting.

2023/03/01 07:34,Engetani B,"Bad customer service received eveeeeeer,not expected this at capitec bank","On the 24th Feb 2023 around 16:00pm went to capitec bank Florida branch to open a minor account since I wanted to invest for my little one, I had all Fica required docs with me ,but didn't have a cellphone with me and cellphone number to use. 

Zandile the assistant branch manager told me that unfortunately I can't be assisted if I don't have a phone and cellphone number with me,she advised that I should get a capitec bank sim card,but I told her that I don't want it I prefer to use a different network, but with attitude she replied ""why don't you want to use capitec sim card,then go buy a sim card of your choice and come back.

Then I  went to a  pep store to buy a simcard,when I come back around 16:27pm ,I got assisted by Sphume the service Consultant, I asked him if will I get help if I provide them with the cellphone number, but my phone is currently off because Zandile said the phone and the sim needs to be present for me to get helped,I asked if is there anyway they can open an account for me since I have a cellphone number then I will come back with the phone to update for cellphone  banking some other day.The SC was willing to assist but he went to confirm with Zandile,but with attitude again sitting by the computer near the door ,she said but I already told the lady we can't assist.

Then on the 27th Feb 2023 went to Clearwater mall capitec branch ,they opened an account for me ,Pearl assisted me very well and explained the process that even if I don't have aphone right away I can update cellphone numbers and come back later to update cellphone banking and sms notifications and she did confirm that they are in the same region  with Florida branch .

So I'm not happy so disappointed, where is transparency, good customer service ,why I was forced to take capitec sim,Why is people don't get helped if they don't want a certain product?,because I waisted my time to the branch yet someone lied and selfish, rude because of they want to reach their target I guess in my expense.I need to know how come same banks in the same region but different rules but same capitec bank products mhmmmmmmm Florida branch is this how you treat your customers???????????????....or you help people according to their standards, you profile a person first????????.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

They do not take the client's financial situation into account. I lost my job and made arrangements with capitec. I was told that the arrangement was for me to pay a set amount monthly. To my surprise they reverted to the initial instalment a month later. So I decided it was OK they could do that because that was the initial installment I had began with. 
59 day after that I get a deduction of the arranged instalment. What the heck so I go to their branch and get told that it can be reversed and that there are arrangements in place going forward.
A month later I get debited two instalments of the original installment. In a space of 2 days. Guys what is going on. When I get to the branch I'm told it can't be reversed because I don't have an arrangement. 
I know I owe Capitec but there is no company that will deduct twice in a week for a person who gets paid monthly. Please return my money

2023/02/28 16:28,David,Lack of assistance,"I have an issue with Capitec and their lack of assistance.
My father-in-law died of Covid in July 2021. He had a Capitec account and receipt of the letter of executorship Capitec were contacted to arrange the closure of the account in February 2022. Their reference was **********5.
On 4 March they advised “Kindly be advised that there are R12.83 in the account, Please advise if we can write this off and continue to close the account.”
On 7 March I responded with the Estate Bank account details and requested that the account be closed.
They failed to respond to this and a call to the call centre in July 2022 confirmed that account had been closed.
Unbeknown to me my father-in-law sold a company which had this Capitec account listed with SARS for VAT purposes. The company claim a VAT refund in November 2022 and SARS paid this into the “closed” account.
Every attempt to get this resolved with Capitec has resulted in sort and unprofessional responses. The tone of each email was that I was in effect wasting their time and they were in no way going to assist in resolving this issue. They now claim they never closed the account and that nobody gave a closure instruction. Reference **********94
On presenting them with the proof of the closure instruction their poor response was “We do not deal with estate accounts and did not close any estate account”
SARS are also not prepared to reverse the payment without confirmation that the account has been closed (which it was in July 2022), so I am stuck with 2 parties who don’t want to assist nor understand.
Clearly they are enjoying sitting on money which belongs to someone else, which in effect is nothing short of theft!",1,1,"Good day DavidThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Since then all I am receiving a standard account closure letter which creditors doesn't want as account were opened in my name which I don't know about.

I did all of this on the 12/02/2023.  To this day my matter has never been attended to, no correspondence on the proceedings have ever been communicated to me.  I have instead made countless of attempts to follow up but I am not receiving any help or feedback to date (3 weeks after the initial incident).

2023/02/27 12:23,Crown T,Very poor service,"I live in the Eastern Cape in a small town called Whittlesea, I was at one of the Service stations (ENGEN) with a Capitec ATM withdrawing money R1200 to be exact, 

The ATM only dispensed R500 and a message on the screen said ERROR MACHINE RESSETING, 

I reported the matter to a lady who said she was in charge of ATM complaints at the garage and she told me to wait a few minutes the money will ne refunded back to my account by the bank an that was on a Friday afternoon, 

Monday morning still no money in my account and I went back to the service Station and the owner ""GREG"" was very rude and told me he is very busy and doesn't have time to listen to my story. 

Capitec please sort this out as I need that money ASAP.

2023/02/26 21:07,Yogesh,Capitec(please learn customer service),"In December 2022 I went into the branch(Capitec Liberty Mall Pietermaritzburg) to inform them that I am starting a new job and my new salary date will be on the 28th of every month , So I requested that from January 2023 they can start debiting an expense from me on the 28th and moving forward . I been to the branch twice , I must say this is the worst experience to get a debit order date changed , you are treated like a criminal with the amount of requirements needed, anyways on my second visit to the branch in the first week off January 2023 I submitted the requirements and was told the debit will go off on Jan 28th and it will be the new debit date, On January 25th I saw they tried to debit and It also took away the small funds i had for my small debits , so all my debits now got returned , Long story short after talking too so many people , calls wasted , requirements needed again , submitted everything , Not one manager  gave me a call to assist , even the branch manager did nothing . Escalated this to capitec complaints who ignored my complaint and just asked for further required documents . So i said I'm not going to fight as long as its now sorted. They did it again , On Feb 25th they did the debit again even after confirming with me that its all been fixed . I had a standard bank debit changed with a 10min call at the branch , utmost professionalism from Standard Bank , that's why I say these newcomers cant buy class, Standard bank treat their customers with great service and instead of making our busy lives more hectic they had quick solutions for changes on our accounts unlike Capitec.  I am so upset because Capitec cannot get a debit date changed with being notified since Dec 2022. incident number is #**********27    . Wake up Capitec and stop treating clients like criminals. I had to prove so many things to get my debit moved 3 days later which still did not happen!!!!",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/25 12:46,Keanu F,Capitec Holding My Funds Hostage,"Capitec Bank has permanently closed my account due to ""multiple fraud cases"" made against me and for the sole reason of ""trading on behalf of others""

Both the above statements are false and aren't being backed up by Capitec.

Firstly, yes I was trading on a secure platform called Binance. By means of using their P2P market, I bought and sold crypto currency from other individuals via the website. 

Not once have I ever traded on behalf of someone else nor do you have proof that I was as mentioned by your forensics department ?

Secondly, the case that was made in January revolving the transcation on the 31st of December. That has absolutely nothing to do with me, all documents have been provided by myself and the young lady and yet Capitec still has the nerve to state that the mentioned case is also part of the reason my account is locked.

You stated that there are multiple fraud cases made against me yet no case was directly made against me?

There are two incidents, the above mentioned and the person that unfortunately paid frauded funds into my bank account. How does anybody verify that the funds they are being paid in relations to selling something is not frauded, please inform me?

Capitec are quick to make false assumptions and allegations against me without backing up the above mentioned information and don't even mention that I am allowed to take my funds out of the account. 

Instead all they tell me when I had to call many many many times per day for weeks is that the account will remain permanently locked due to the multiple fruaud cases, trading on the account and trading on behalf of others. 

Please do show me a single fraud case made DIRECTLY against me and prove that I was trading on behalf of others. 

Absolutely disgusting that you now hold the funds in my account that has nothing to do with this investigation hostage, leaving me to ask friends and family for money to eat.

This must leave a great sense of pride in your eyes as a bank, using your so called ""justice system"" to slander and punish those you feel fit.

I have contacted the Ombudsman to help me get my money out of the bank that is right fully mine. You're absolutely the worst bank that I have ever dealt with, keep the account closed by all means but release the funds that belong to me.

Legally you cannot steal my money just because of the false statements made against me. You support services have been nothing more than a headache to me, thanks for making me need to suffer and beg others for money to eat.",1,1,"Good day Keanu De FrancaThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

The Capitec ATM in my area only provided me with R650, the remaining amount of 200 was not received. I called within that hour to be resolved was advised it would take 7-14 and the reference  numb will be provided. I called in 7 days, called after 14 days was advised by the call centre agent that on there side the funds shows R850 was withdrawn and I will not be refunded as it is not there issue and I am not due for the R200. I constantly  called the Capitec department know could assist. I called around the 21st of February  and I spoke to one of the complaints agents David and he looked up with the query . The call cut and he called me back in which he was the only agent to call me back he advised I will Definitely receive the funds giving me his word. He said it will take within 48 hours , he will either call me or send me an SMS taking down the times to call me, however I have not received any call or sms there after!. I called many times again including the 24th of February one of the agents I spoke to was rude and when I asked to speak to the manager she did like and while speaking to her she just puts me on hold. Later the call cut. I called again asked to speak to the manager she advised the manager will call me either the 24th of February before 8pm or in the morning on the 25th of February I still have not received any call for this to be resolved. I called in today 25th of February spoke to many agents AGAIN with know help. I spoke to Zandile, Happy, Thembi, Kimberly, Khanyi, David and others. I had to ask Kimberly for the reference numbers in which I have. How can this be my fault I went to a Capitec ATM thinking I will get R850 however Capitec only gave me R650 , I still followed the procedures and called Capitec to advise what had happen. How should I know that the ATM was faulty. I am a client and trusting my money with Capitec , withdrawing from Capitec ATm the ATM did not give me the correct withdrawal amount but I've been told it's not Capitecs fault!

2023/02/24 10:57,Dirk,Don't use Capitec,"On the 20th my account was blocked, I was advised that someone that paid me a mere R500 was involved in something relating to a fraud case, so I was told to write an affidavit which I did, I was then told to write a more detailed affidavit (without really having details because they can't give me info because if the Popu act) but I made a plan and wrote a more detailed affidivit, after being to the branch 3 times, calling the call center +-8 times I'm still where I was the first day, I don't really know why my account was blocked, now the real problem I have with this bank is yesterday my debit orders started bouncing as my account is blocked, now with all the hassles I allready went through like sitting in the police station, sitting in the branch, driving up and down etc. Now I also have to call all my debtors explaining this ridiculous situation to them so I can do eft's for this month and move all my debit orders to another bank etc.  This is really a big nightmare and all I get is a ""sorry neh"", I'm told if I'm not happy about this I should lay a complaint with Capitec.  I'm urging people to please reconsider using Capitec, this is the worst experience I've ever experienced, these guys are playing with a persons name and to top it all off they can't give you all the details because you're account is blocked because of someone elses issues.",1,1,"Good day Dirk Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/24 09:13,Adrian,Capitec is nonchalant about Facebook fraud.,I was defrauded due to Capitec using Facebook as their online support channel. The fraudsters reversed 3 (PAID) debit orders worth R5700 and made off with all my cash as well. I reported the fraud to the Police and to Capitec's fraud and Forensics departments. I emailed Capitec's fraud and Forensics departments the exact details of the fraud and the addresses of the fraudulent Capitec Facebook pages three days ago. The pages are still up and I haven't heard a word from Capitec regarding this matter. I learned this: Capitec has so much fraud that they can't get to reading email that shows the exact Facebook addresses of the fraudulent Capitec pages. That Capitec allows people to reverse large debit orders on an adhoc basis. Most of all I learned that Capitec hangs you out to dry when you need them most. The detective told me that this nonsense is commonplace with Capitec. Well done...I suppose... I am of the opinion that Capitec is the ESKOM of the banking industry with their nonchalant attitude towards fraud and corruption.,1,1,"Good day Adrian Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/24 08:44,Siviwe N,Pathetic treatment from Capitec bank,"From Last year I had been sending money to my son who was boarding in one of areas in the Eastern Cape where he was finishing his matric. Before he would use his bank card to swipe whatever he needs in the sounding shops. While swiping he his card would decline and he would ask if i have sent him money and the answer would be yes. After several swiping attempts, he decided to go to the bank and ask. At the bank they told him that his account was suspected to be involved in a fraud activity. Apparently as per what they told him, someone deposited an amount of R80 + R1, then immediately an amount of R70 was sent out in a form of ""cash send"". My son new nothing about this as there was no SMSs on his phone regarding this as the money deposited was less than R100. So he was then told to go and write the affidavit at the police station so that they may reinstate his account. Indeed he went and do the affidavit and stating that he had no knowledge of what he was told at the bank, submitted it at the bank. He was then told that he will recieve an SMS when the account is reinstated. So after couple of months he went back to the bank and was told to write another affidavit, and he went to do it again.  Begging September he told me that his account was put on hold. Mind you, I had been sending him money all along. So in September I didnt send him money in that account. Had not have my mother whom he would go to when he needs something, he was going to stave to death as he was not asking me for money. Fast forward, Last month, Jan 2023 we both went to the bank again to enquire about this. At the Garden's bank branch in Cape town, we were told about the time this incident (01 Feb 2022), In the Eastern Cape he was never told all the details. Again we were told to write an affidavit, we did and submited it. After 7 days were went back to bank and we were told that the information on the affidavit was not enough. Went back and do another affidavit and submitted it again and waited another 7 days. After that we went to the bank, that time I was only demanding only the money i deposited to my son's account and i was told to bring proof of payments so that they can unlock the account and withdraw the money i have sent to his account, as he claimed that I am the only one who sent him money and so  I provided them with the proof of payments made. This time I was told that I will not get that money back. 

The lady who was assisting me was even bold to say, ""the money i deposited is very ""little"", many people lost their salaries and big moneys for events like this"". She then said if I still need my money I must go and claim it at the ""small claims"". She went on to say, ""about 80% of the people who to "" small claims"" never got their money and the bank benefitted. 

From that day i took a decision not to ever use my Capitec bank account again as I lost trust in them. So I was also told that my son will never again have an account with them in the future. I need nothing to do with them in my entire life.

2023/02/23 07:17,Pertunia,DISCUSTING MISCONDUCT BY CAPITEC BANK!!!!!,Capitec decided to freeze my account and labeling me as practicing fraudulent activities on my account without gathering more information about the person who reported my account. I was in disbelieve when a consultant at Fourways branch told me that they do not request any proof from the person who made the claims about my account which I found it very concerning that someone can walk into a bank and make claims and the bank make decisions on the spot without even consulting me. How can a person that I have been supplying from 2021 with a trail of payments I received from her go to the bank and tell the bank I am a fraud and the bank took her side without consulting me - Did you guys not have any sort of qualifying question that you need to ask this complainants before taking their stories??? Now I have been thrown from pillar to post regarding my own money - having to make affidavits to support my truth. I have all the proof that I didn't defraud her. Worse of it all why are you not contacting her for making all this false accusations because she now have a products and I am being told they cant. Which baffles me because if you listened to her story from the beginning and decided to take action not to contact me and now I'm here to prove that I'm not a fraud and you cant even question her??? What kind of a mess id this???? I have all her payment notifications on SMS and my statement can back that up but NO its not sufficient you need proof of payment - the same proof of payment you never ask her when she came to report my account. I have now couriered her items and she received which I have prove that she has received them and the bank still cant do nothing about it....This is my damn business money and ya'll treat us like this.... Worse of it all they say I must be the one to ask her to go back to the bank and cancel the claims - and my question is what are you as a bank doing?? someone walks in make allegations about me and you do whatever you do why cant you now go back as part of your investigation ask her if did I not deliver. Nobody's money is safe with CAPITEC BANK because after discovering that someone can walk in the bank to make false claims about you they will just take action without notifying you. When you come with all evident to prove your innocent that to them is not sufficient. And yet we trust you with our money????,1,1,"Good day Pertunia Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/22 22:24,Jannes P,Fraud,I really had a bad experience today with capitec Support and fraud. I have been contacted by a close friend of mine I know this person did not have money and had no data haven't been in contact I get a msg randomly from this person who told me this is her new number and requested me to lend her money I was busy at the stage and I just assumed it was her and I did lend her money. She was asking me about it when I would send it she gave me me a number I sent it to that number via the app. I then tried calling on the number that contacted me no answer so I decided to call on the old number she answered having no clue about the money to realize someone impersonated her which turns out to be her cousins friend which obvoisly  knows me through the cousin my name where I stay and some info. I call capitec to try and do a reversal they say okay there's a process fine freeze the money they ask me if I know this person where the money went to I said no coz I don't know the cousins friend so they call the person where the money went to she then tells the bank we had a agreement and with the knowledge of the cousin she knows some detail of me. I phone the bank again they closed the case saying it's a civil case. So how on earth do you fight fraud like this? I'm telling the bank I don't know the person the person committed the fraud is believed by the bank. So anyone according to capitec that stalks you to get some info about you requests money with an impersonated whatsapp account wil be believed by the bank the case wil just be closed due to being a civil matter and they can just use the same account to continue committing fraud.,1,1,"Good day Jannes Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/22 03:37,JJ M,Capitec add arrears interest and fees on account that was never in arrears,"For the last few months I regularly notice that on your app you show that my personal loan is in arrears with a full payment.

How can this be? I never once missed a payment as you take the payment every month via debit order. I have complained about this twice before and your answer is then that I am not in arrears. 
Today I decided to check my statement and noticed that you have added interest and fees on arrears for the last few months, maybe more, since I only requested a 90 day statement.

There must be some problem on your side as the adding od these arrears fees and arrears interest is actually stealing from me.

I'm going to report this at the ombudsman and I am going to fight this. 

Capitec has started to disappoint me and if it is going on like this I must start looking for another banker. 
Also I want to report this on social media and the press.

And every time I complain here you email me and assure me my loan account is not in arrears. But this is recurring ever month now.

I want this rectified ASAP or else you must explain me how it is possible that I am in arrears with a full payment for the last few months or maybe more when you deduct a debit order every month on payday. 

It has happened that you deduct the payment before the pay date sometimes and there is obviously no funds before I get paid BUT still it was paid afterward. But this is YOUR problem not mine as I agreed to my debit order date as the 22 of each month and NOT before that.

Explain the arrears fees and interest.

The balance is nearly the same as the original loan amount now again because of this. 

I need answers and rectification ASAP.",1,1,Your statement shows that I am a full payment in arrears.xa0When exactly did I got to be a full payment in arrears? Is there any month that my debit order did not go through???,2023-02-22 03:44:21

2023/02/21 20:11,Willize L,Truly a superhero Bank that always puts their clients first.,"I have been with Capitec more than 15 years and they most definitely have my loyalty for life. When Capitec started with their credit department things was very easy and through the years I have been blessed with Capitec employees that have been very helpful and knowledgeable. However, end of last year my luck turned for the worst and long story short, I was very upset because I felt like a loyal client. After lodging a complaint in order for someone to help me, Capitec didn't think twice and they came running like a Superhero.

We are all human and we make mistakes but it is how we go forward that matters in the end and Capitec truly has a talent for their helpfulness and kindness while they are at it. 

A bank that truly listens to their clients and meet their every need.",5,1,"Good day WillizeThank you for taking time to acknowledge great service, it makes our jobs worthwhile.",2023-02-21 21:45:38

2023/02/21 19:30,Basani,Leak of knowledge and Sympathy,"My late aunt when to Malamulele Branch last year when she was very ill because she need funds  to buy medication but the branch was unable to assist with a replacement card, the sad part  was how they treated her after my parents asked that she must to go to the queue the approach was not nice and they even  fought with my parents that day. 
The card was not issued because the system was down and even when they saw that she was sick they just sent her away and did not explain to my parents what they need to do so they can access funds to buy medication  no advise  from the staff  and I do feel that if they assisted us  and provided the information we need for us to get portion of the funds today maybe things would be different. 
Then after she passed  I went back to the same branch to be assisted to get her statement to release funds for her funeral expenses and I would like to Thank the branch manager Matimba  he assisted us and explained everything we need for everything we need to release the funds and the services went well Thank you and this comes from  the whole family",3,1,"Good day BasaniThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/21 19:00,Henry V,Unprofessional staff,"Went to Capitec in Seapoint on 21 February 2023 to update phone number. 
Only 2 consultants were working. The one female customer was cracking jokes with two guys she was assisting and took ages. 

The very same consultant left her customers and assisted the lady at the front who was busy with a male client. She loudly exclaimed that the client doesn't qualify for something cause he earns less than R10000. 
The flustered guy then asked her why she has to tell the whole bank about it. She just walked off back to her desk and ignored him. 
The embarressed guy just turned and walk away. 

The waiting period for myself was also unacceptably long. Not the first time I'm disappointed with staff at this branch. 
The staff is generally apathetic and unhelpful. Usually more preoccupied with each other than customers. Joking and laughing loudly at times. 

Very unprofessional with the exception of one young man who assisted me today.",1,1,"Good day HenryThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/21 16:14,Helen P,Fraud or schemes to make money?,"Good day, I have cancelled my cell c account december 2021 already, made more than 20 phone calls to confirm, send a couple of emails also to confirm, but I still get billed every month with different amounts every month. A new debit order got it's way into my account which i didnt authorize, since I also got a new bank card after loosing my old card. Is Capitec allowed to give out new card numbers to other businesses without my consent? Also can Capitec aauthorize a debit order from a cellphone company without my consent? Do they send ""fake"" or tampered proof through to banks just to continue making money without my consent? I went to capitec and the friendly lady said she's not allowed to cancel any debit orders, I have to take it up with the business. Which I did, and it seems like a game they play to see who can win in the end? Cell phone companies so called record your phone call for reasons who knows what, since when you ask them for the proof, the call cannot be traced back. Has anyone else been struggling to close down a cell phone contract and having difficulty with your bank, who is supposed to support you from fraud? Ending debt is a good thing, but it seemed like a plot of evil between banks and cell phone companies to see how long they can still steal your money from breadwinner moms like me?

2023/02/21 13:35,Marlene B,Capitec Security Useless,"I have been a capitec client for a very long time.  Always promoting them for their low fees and excellent service when I opened my account.  I have also opened bank accounts for my three daughters, of who two are now adults, and can operate their bank account without my assistance.  However, now that Capitec has for a while been adding the physical account numbers to the front of the bank card, and not only the card number, I saw a problem coming.  Recently my daugthers phone was stolen with her bank card, and some way or another the thieves drew all her money from her capitec bank card.  We went into the bank, and even a transaction that was still pending, was allowed by Capitec Bank after we went to see them.
All her money is gone, and Capitec Bank does not take any responsibility for their mistakes - ie, letting the pending transaction go through, not following up with the mentioned vendors on the account and stopping the transactions with bidorbuy, and snapscan.  Also having her account number on the front of the card, just made it so much easier.  They (The Criminals) increased her limits, they withdrew ALL her money from her different bank accounts, without having any alerts go on at Capitec Bank.    Now Capitec washes their hands like Pilatus, and takes NO responsibility.
Suddenly they also started doing this stupid QR code scanning for extra security measures.  Just another way of trying to not make your problem theirs.
I am so disappointed, and will be moving my accounts to another, more secure bank.  I will advise all people to be very careful with Capitec Bank's security, as their are none!!",1,1,"Good day MarleneThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I placed myself on debt review a couple of years ago but after my maternity leave I returned to chaos with all my creditors and opted to change my debt  counseling company. This was towards the end of August 2022, beginning of September 2022. I have managed to sort out all of my creditors except my Capitec Credit Card, my documents must have been missed because Capitec Bank proceeded to remove me from debt review in October 2022. The gentleman who continuously gives me such an attitude without fail every single time he calls, I take my hat off to you my dear. For your tone and lack on interest in actually getting the facts, I dont think you are in the right line of work, your passion lacks. I received a call on 9 February 2023, after I made my calls from December 2022 up until February 2023, a lady explaining that they have misplaced my paperwork and requested that my counselors re submit (this was to DebtReviewTerminations Department) , which was done on 10 February 2023. Today 20 February 2023, the same gentleman from the Credit Rehabilitation Department is not willing to hear what I have to say but demands that we get to an amount. Please can someone that knows what they are doing or knows whats actually going on with my account call me please? I am so confused, and not to mention frustrated.

Guess what, Capitec did try to debit my account, which bounced because of insufficient funds. This has happened before and after numerous calls and complaints I was promised that It would not happen again. Yet, every month as soon as my salary is paid, Capitec debits, whether it is on the 25th or not. This month it was on the 17th long before my salary date of the 25th.

By The consultant but according to them the call was dropped so nothing was done when I asked a week later with another transaction going through why didn't Capitec phone me back ?sorry sir  that we do not to do that's up to you to phone us back with no toll free number. what a bank and you think that I moved from my bank FNB to Capitec Capitec what a joke . Now the fraud team will investigate if I subscribed to anything without putting a security pin  And they will decide if my money gets returned because capitecs security system Allows fraudulent transactions . I was not ask for a security pin like Capitec ask even for 60 minutes checkers is under R100 but for other amounts of R750 and R52 and whatever no confirmation of pin is needed .

Im so frustated at Capitec Bank. I bought 200GB prepaid LTE data yesterday (17/02/2023) for work. The transaction was successful on the Vodacom website, money went out from my Capitec account. But still even today, no data has reflected on my account.

Vodacom and Capitec have been playing a blame game, and Im still not having my issue resolved.

I have being on the phone to calling them to NO success of their consultants resolving my issue. And they seem to have no clue on how to resolve it. Im so dissapointed and frustrated, hence Im working from home, amd have started with work due to this issue.

I want them to reverse the funds back to my account immediately, so I can purchase the DATA somewhere else.",1,1,"Good day NosihleThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/17 15:55,Russel E,Only solution from Capitec - You must go into the Bank to fix anything because we are an online bank!!,"I opened a fixed term deposit account, after a 1 month the interest that I received was transferred to another savings account instead of remaining in the fixed term account. My previous fixed term did not do this.
I called the Capitec help line and explained this to Tandeka.  She said I need to go to the branch to fix it.  I said I do do not want to go to a bank, that's is why I do online/App banking.  She then said I can just transfer the interest back to the fixed term account.  I told her that I tried this and I don't want to do that each moth. She said then I must go to the bank.  Or she can unfix the term.  I asked her would there be costs.  She put me on hold and returned after 2min to tell me there are costs.  I asked her how much. She said she did not know. I asked her to find out how much.  Again on hold.  She comes back and says she cannot unfix it because the balance is too high, so I must go to the bank.  I asked for a manager.  Now I'm on the phone for 25min already and all she can say is that to change the selection on the fixed deposit is to go to the bank. So I ask for a senior manager. Waited for another 7min to be told that the senior manager is in a meeting and that they will log the issue and I will be contacted in 24hrs.  What is the point of a help line that cannot help? What is the pint of App banking when the only way you can fix anything is going into the bank?  Their slogan is ""the way to bank""; it should be go to the bank""!!!",1,1,"Good day Russel Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/17 14:11,Elton H,Capitec costing me time and money,"Today was very embarresing for me. I went to buy a car battery and when I wanted to pay my card was declined. I asked the shop to try again. Again declined. So very embarresed and confused I left the store. I logged onto my internet banking to discover my bank account is gone! So I phoned client care. The lady informed me there was an amount of R5400 paid into my account on the 17th of October 2022 from a client which was/is from a involved fraud case. How this has anything to do with me or my business I do not know!! Now Capitec froze my account! No phone call, no warning, just frozen! The lady from client care said I must go make an affidavit at the Police station and get a certified ID copy and take it to a Capitec branch, which I did. The person at the branch was rather helpfull, scanned my affidavit, ID and the contract I had from the person who paid the money into my account for the rental and sent it to the fraud division. He said it would take about 2 hours. Its now 4 hours later. I cannot pay my clients or any of my accounts! Who are now very annyoyed at me! Absolutely shocking! So if you sell any product or service and they suspect the person who paid you was involved in fraud or theft, you the innocent client of Capitec gets punished! Is costs me alot of time and money being away from work to try and sort this out.

2023/02/17 13:25,Chantal C,If your phone is ever stolen - there is NO OTHER way to access account!,"The young man that helped me open an account few years back, was brilliant and helpful.  It took me a while to get used to not using internet banking, but got used to it and comfortable - feel safe and at ease.  Then my phone gets stolen!  As a Capitec client - you are then royally done for.... So I call the customer care, after trying to connect to internet banking - they inform me that I must activate it via the app...I just explained my phoned was stolen...really...then she tells me only way to activate it then is to go into the bank.  Fine, so today I went to purchase a phone after insurance paid out, went into the bank prior getting the phone, knowing it will take a day to activate sim swap, to ask for access for internet banking because my phone was stolen...this woman - looks like she is listening - tells me after explaining why I need internet banking because my phone was stolen - tells me I can only do it via the app....or pay R129 but keep in mind Capitec is going to discontinue internet banking. So why did the consultant I spoke to sending me into the bank tell me this...and they could not activate it without paying for something which is going to end soon.  So - if you are a Capitec client, their app is brilliant, but if your phone is stolen - its almost useless having an account because there is NO OTHER way to access your account.",2,1,"Good day Chantal Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Why is it a problem if we borrow each other money, why do we need permission from the bank, the amounts are not even in the thousands, it's 500, 100, 1000, why are we not getting assistance when we've been clients for so long.

I went in today to report a withdrawal I made  at Sasol on Lavender road. When I went to the branch, I was given a ticket number 30 with no estimated waiting time but that was not a big concern. Different ticket numbers were called to different departments until  my number was close. Ticket 28,29 and 31 were called but mine was never called. I asked the Bank Better Champion, Keletso why my number was skipped and she advised that I am still queued and that I should sit down and wait for my number to be called which I did, until I realised that we were in the 50s to which I asked the service consultant as to how the system works and she advised I should “complain” at the door which I did. Their solution was to give me a new ticket which was now in the 80s and no apology was offered neither was there an alternative solution offered for my query. I left the branch very upset because they refused to assist. There were people that came in, skipped the queue because they were people they knew. There were other people complaining about the service received from the staff members and how they seem to to not care. Please do something about this as this will damage the reputation of the brand and cause the company great loss.

2023/02/15 15:51,Tiffany T,Ghosted and forgetten,"I have been so deeply deeply frustrated with the business banking application process with Mercantile Bank. After doing much research and asking for recommendations, we were told that they were the best. We started our application on 2 August 2022 just after registering our company on the CIPC portal and promptly received a phone call. The process was smooth until the docusign wouldn't work. After some troubleshooting the rep dealing with our case seemed to give up and stopped responding. After some time I called their main lines again to either pick up the process or restart it - got a call from an agent and he pulled up our info and seemed extremely competent, until he also proceeded to ghost us after completing the docusign details.
We have signed all documents, forms etc and received confirmation thereof but have received no information on our actual bank account, haven't received our cards, haven't received a call nothing. 
It is now 7 months down the line and we do not even know if we have a bank account or not!!
We shouldn't have to beg to set up our business bank account, it's ridiculous.",1,1,"Good day Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/15 15:39,Samantha,Capetec Bank Refund Nightmare,"From pillar to post I have been taken for over a month now. I was under debt review and settled my last account. Even having spoken to Debt Busters and informing them to please move debit order as the date they wanted to debit me on was not the agreed upon date. They ran their debit distributed the amounts and then leaving Capitec Loan over paid. I requested a refund in early January, together with my clearance certificate. Lauren Damon sent me an email informing me that Capitec bank will be paying in 10 working days. 12 January, the 25 of January still nothing. I send email. Then Sinoxolo is now following up from Debtbusters to Capitec bank. Capitec Bank then says that there was some sort of issue and that they will be processing the request. 01 February Sinoxolo contacted Capitec and it was said I would be refunded. Still nothing. 
I call Capitec bank for two days in a row because if you don't say hello they will hang up on you. Nicole Boltney then sends the email to Bronwyn Louw saying she is escalating the matter as she could see that I have been sending emails. Mind you this acknowledgement of my emails shows the lack if urgency in wanting to assist the client. on the telephone i asked how long will it take to get feedback... 24 to 48 hours... That was on 09 February... Today is 15 February No communication. Capitec won't pay me back my refund. It is my money. I paid in full. When you have to pay they are quick to deduct but when they have to refund you must wait. Until when??

2023/02/15 12:31,Zandile M,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

I've had an ongoing issue that was supposed to have been sorted out between ""14-21 days"" which has taken more than 3 months now! I logged a fraudulent case on the 28th October 2022, provided an Affidavit and case number as requested and I have since not received any tangible response. Except for, ""the incident was closed I'll have to call to find out why"" to being told, ""we can see the funds are available however I'm not able to confirm why the refund was not processed."" I'm really sick of this diabolical service I've been getting. 

To say I'm frustrated is an understatement. I am tired of the runaround I've been getting from you guys. All I've ever been ""assisted"" with is being passed from pillar to post. After all the runaround I've been getting from you after visiting one of your branches (Burgundy Square) I was told ONCE AGAIN they will look into the matter for me and after calling the ""fraud department"" I was given an email address ""***********"" so that I cam also write to you guys and that this issue will be sorted. Guess what? I wrote and as usual nothing happened. I've sent emails to client care, called only for my calls to be dropped. I've sent messages on your whatsapp number with no assistance. Today I've been told that this is a civil case and that I need to get in touch with the police. After waiting for more than 3 months this is all you have to say?

Below are the names of all the consultants who have seemingly ""tried"" to assist me as they have claimed but here I am still sitting with an issue from 28 October 2022.

2023/02/15 10:58,Yandani L,"Don't be thieves, bring my money back!","Last month Capitec Bank debited R250 more than they should have on a loan repayment so I assumed that this month they would let me pay R500 of the R750 monthly repayment of the loan. But instead the lady I spoke to on the phone told me that she wasn't sure if Capitec would actually do that and when I look at my amount payable status it says I should pay R750 again this month even though they already took the R250 last month so what I want to know is this, if Capitec is not going to credit me then what are they going to do with the extra money they too from me last month? 

I also need Capitec to know this, personally I would like to never have anything to do with this bank ever again and being blacklisted is not an issue for me because I'll just stop paying the loan and continue to live in this hole I am living in right now. I've been doing my part and paying back the loan as best as I can without any arrears but this bank is now taking it too far by trying to steal from me",1,1,"Good day Yandani Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

And now, I still don’t have access to this account after supplying all the needed paper work and affidavits weeks ago and Capitec just cannot seem to tell me why. My last contact with Capitec was on Friday the 10th and they actually said that the account is active again but I still cannot access this account on mobile banking or internet, it still does not show on my dashboard.

2023/02/15 07:22,Ali A,CAPITEC PATHETIC AND BAD SERVICE,"Greetings once again

South Africa I'm still having a problem which you will never understand until capitec bank starts doing it to you. I posted here last week regarding my current experiences and let me ask you if you are aware of the following:

1. Did you know that if someone deposit money in your capitec account, whether by mistake or purposefully so, and then report your account to capitec, your account woll be blocked for more than 2 weeks for fraud investigations? In that time, ask yourself this- What will your children be eating, how will you be getting to work, how will you be meeting ends meet, now remember this also, capitec had milions of clients they don't care whether they loose you as a client, they have more clients than any other bank so what is 1 client

No, are you prepared to go through all this, are you prepared to eat b your children suffer? Right now it hasn't happened to you hence you won't understand or feel the pain

2. Are you aware that even if you send yourself money from your other account repeatedly so, and capitec feels the need to investigate they block your account without anyone reporting, I am a forex trader, my account with capitec always had large amounts, and as we speak, I can use the little that's in thag account because capitec blocked it since last week. I have children, they are starving every day, rent is overdue, today is the 15th, my policies are meant to be debuting and that's not gonna happen. 

Listen to me, whatever you do, change your salary bank, do not let your salary go into capitec because the day it's blocked you will remember me. They can block R2000 because of R50, that's what they do, they don't care. Also how sad for all this BLACK consultants working at capitec, they are used to oppress black people because white people just see every black person as a suspect and not white enough to have ex amount of money in their account 

The sad part is that once your account is blocked, and you decide to go into the branch, the branch will tell you they can't do anything because it's with forensics, but then they tell u to visit your nearest branch. People this is not a joke, this is rather very serious. Since my account was blocked I have not been able to do anything, I haven't been able to sleep. I even said to them, ohk to you say there's a R700 complaint against my account, but you can see the account has been ranging in thousands of monies, so you are given the permission to block that R700 or whatever while you investigate and release the rest of my Monies, they are ignoring that. Also bare in mind what this banks do, while your account is blocked, they take your money and invest it into the stock markets, while you waiting for it, it's busy earning them interest, so while your life and your family's lives are at risk they are enriching themselves 

I have reported this issue to different stake holders, I'm just waiting but I woll sue this bank not just in the court of law, I woll gather all the victims and we will have the court of public opinion, which matters a lot, and one way of the other, everyone who had ever suffered in the hands of capitec will get justice. Let me tell you this, no one is above the law, the banks are banks because of people and people's monies within those banks, so just because capitec bank feels they now have enough clients they can start taking advantage. And rember capitec most clients are black people, some of which are very disadvantaged so they know that and that's why when their apps aren't working they don't even have the decency to address the nation in a proper way. So. Wake up south Africa, I woll keep in touch. Today is over a week since my account is blocked, is over a week since inproclvided a detailed affidavit that they ask for, is over a week since I gave them a certified copy of the ID, it's over a week since I gave them everything they needed, the 24/48 hours that the consultants told me that it will take have lapsed.

What hurt me the most is that I made means to go and inquire about payment arrangement they never helped me or explain anything. Instead they shattered the door on my face. I never said I am failing to pay. I didn't run away nor avoid their calls, I was cooperating all the way but they took advantage of that by throwing me straight to dept counselling. I WANT MY NAME REMOVED FROM DEPT COUNSELLING, I never agree to that. Even worst when I check Vertex ""dept counselling"" account it's like I took another new loan. I now have two accounts with two different amounts. Every cent that I paid Capitec it's making no difference. I have two accounts (loan) but I used only one. On the other hand my name is ruined. Capitec bank should have warned me that it is a crime to go through financial difficulties(or fall pregnant) while having a loan with them because to them dept counselling is only the solution. Ruining a person's name without communicating to them is the way for them.

Capitec does not check from their side if the person responsible for the request of the debit order is actually the account holder.

2023/02/14 01:12,Lillian ,Capitec bank a scam,"Capitec has proven to me that they are all about stealing money from clients 
On the 20th of December just at midnight a debit order of a very strange amount I've never seen before went off my account 
Immediately when I saw it I logged into my app to check what and who is debating my account, to my surprise I would open the transaction details and tried to dispute it and it wouldn't allow me, 5 attempts with no success then I took a photo of the error it was giving me with my other phone. Then I called their customer service and spoke to a consultant who told me she can't see any debit order from her side and we argue about it as she is telling me there was no money thar went out of my account I had received the notification of a R89 debited from my account with the reference ARACAPIT ARACAPIT14218
The next day in the morning I logged into my app and I managed to dispute it but then I get charged by the same bank for the dispute,why? And learn that afternoon through friends and family that they also had a debit order of the same amount and same reference so who is still clients money?

On the 04 of Jan I decided to pay up my credit card in full and was on a zero balance, I called the bank and told them I do not want their credit card anymore I have paid them every cent I owed them and the the consultant told me that she has requested for my credit card to be closed but it will take 45 days,and I asked why 45 days I have paid every cent owing why can't I have the card discontinued? Then she say in case there debit orders going off on this account they have to keep it active. This is my account and there are no debit orders going off on my credit card,I just wanted the credit card to be closed. 2 weeks later I called the bank again cause I really wasn't happy with what they were telling me, so I spoke to Lucky who then helped me to deactivate my card,then I thought problem solved to my surprise from being on a zero balance I'm now owing bank charges on an account I paid up and owe nothing on the card why financial institutions feel is right to hold us ransom with our own money's why do they think its okay to keep charging unnecessary fees.Capitec wants to keep my account open so they can keep debiting insurance fees,admin fees, retrenchment insurance for what I am no longer owing them, I paid them everything what are they insuring and who are they insuring in thus case. On Friday the 10 I tried calling the credit card division more than 4 times and I was transferred to different consultant who kept putting me on hold for 10 minutes then it will be the wrong department and get transferred to r consultant who were supposedly the correct person to speak to but none of them were, I feel it was deliberately done so until I gave up on calling them. I spent almost an our on calls that didn't get me to any competent person and even after they have verified my details and account details to date no one has tried to contact me, what kind of service is this ?the bank are nothing without the peoples savings but they treated me like they are doing me a favor and they are not. Bad service, 👎 they are revolting,disgusting

2023/02/13 16:56,Nhlakanipho J,Account blocked on false fraud allegation,"On saturday someone visiting jhb from east london had asked me to assist with airfare. I agreed to sponsor half..about R800. Due to miscommunication the person missed her flight and wanted me to reimburse R800. I was not reachable so they called capitec and claimed fraud, I dont know why or how. End result, capitec blocked my account and also notified other banks and consequently all my bank accounts are blocked. The complainant upon realizing the gravity of the situation called in to withdraw, they advised her to get an affidavit. She got it yesterday same time, and emailed. Because it was Sunday. They said fraud department will be back at work on monday, only then will I get unblocked. It's now Monday evening, I've sent plus 3hrs on calls to capitec. First they couldnt locate the affidavit email. She resent it. Secondly, the guy at fraud desk was not around to unblock, probably out for lunch as the consultant put it. They can now see the affidavit, fraud will unblock in an instant., that was 2 hrs back..still nothing. They said they have emailed my other banks the withdrawal email. None of my banks have received any such email. I have exam fees deadlines, travel costs, food costs, financial matters pressing..and I cannot access my funds just because capitec is sitting on my account as if it will lay eggs. After this I'm closing my account. It's really true that quality is expensive.

2023/02/13 15:07,Desigan N,Handling of fraud case,"I have a very serious concern about how a fraud case was handled. I reported what I suspected to be fraud on 8 November 2022. I had been following a Facebook page since August which sells Hot tubs, I contacted the person in September who then sent me a quotation with an account number to make a deposit. I called capitec call centre on 13 October 2022 to check if the account could be verified before I could make a deposit, they couldn't help me. I then went to branch and they said due to the Popi act they would not be able to assist me. I eventually made a deposit to the account on November 1st, after few days the supplier said he was ready to deliver but I had to pay the balance and I didn't want to do that because it wasn't not stated on the quote so I got suspicious, I decided to report the matter to fraud department, I then got the case number and affidavit as requested, the consultant said they would block the account for 48hrs until I provide the docs and also that they had recovered funds and needed the documents so it could be released to me, i sent the documents in time and received the confirmation reply from forensics,on the 10 November I started getting calls from the account holder who was given MY CONTACT Number, I don't know who is involved with this but now I'm messaged and called by this person frequently, a few days later i called for updates,they said they waiting for documents so i sent it again. I called after a week and was told they still working on it and still have the recovered funds. In December i went into the branch and explained the situation to a consultant,he called on my behalf and once more they said they have recovered cash and were waiting fo the affidavit,he sent it through and got another reference **********89. I called him a week later and he said they still busy investigating, i called back in January and now they tell him that the funds were used. By now im extremely frustrated by this outcome so i contacted the banking ombudsman and they said i shoulf speak to complaints resolution with capitec which i did,i sent through all the documents to the consultant via email,she said the team leader will call me by the next day,2 weeks later and i received no response and my email to her hasnt been reponded to.",1,1,Good day Desigan We acknowledge receipt of your query and have assigned your matter to a designated official.

2023/02/12 10:29,Keanu F,Account locked once again..,"Unfortunately here I am once again, my Capitec account has been locked for the second time this year.

The first situation was extremely depressing to deal with, someone had involved me in their fraud case but never once stated that I committed any fraud.

Capitec got notified by FNB that I was the one committing the fraud without clearly reading the affidavit and my account was locked for 9 days on a false fraud case that wasn't even made against me.

The amount of stress resulted from those nine days, I had to call and worry about how I was going to pay for food and get by for the month as I would get little to no help regarding the situation.

Now someone has paid frauded funds into my bank account which I used to pay another client. Capitec has locked my account once again and asked me to submit all necessary information to provide proof as to why the transaction took place but in the same breath said that I will have the money reversed from my bank account ??

I submitted all the information required on the same day, a few hours later in a panic at the Capitec branch. I asked the woman who helped me if there is any sort of way a client could ever verify a transaction if someone payed frauded funds into their account and she said no.

I am sitting from Tuesday worrying about ever getting access to my bank account and having that amount of money reversed. I've given up on Capitec being there for their customers, the first case is still active from the 12/01/2023. I can only imagine how long this is going to take to get the ""investigating"" completed.

I wanted to close my Capitec account but decided to leave it after the first incident got resolved, I should have done it immediately when I had to opportunity.

I'm really tired of this treatment Capitec, I truly am.",1,1,"Good day Keanu Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/11 23:12,Ali A,CAPITEC BANK DESTROYING MY LIFE,"Greetings people

Guys capitec bank is taking advantage of thr fact thag mosg of its clients are black people and mostly disadvantaged. This bank is really exploiting us. As we speak my account is blocked because apparently there's too many transactions being made in between accounts. They are accusing me of fraud, because I have sent money from my own discovery account to my Capitec account too many times, how has that become fraud when a man send money to himself. They claim thag someone complained about R700 or she sent to me, and R125 x 2 that was sent to me, but there's no record of such transactions, and even if there was why would they block over R9000 just because of that. I write an affidavit telling them. I have no knowledge of such and thag if that's the case they must block whatever money is in question and release the rest but they are choosing to block everything. They told me to go to the police station to write a detailed affidavit I did so, then to send slcerrified copy of my ID I did so. What this bank is doing is making my children suffer. My kids didn't go to school, they had no money for transport, imagine your child telling you to not forget to send money for supper, now you ahve to explain how capitec has blocked your account to your kids

They had no reason to block the account because they can't even provide details of the complainanttheres no actual police case that has warranted them to block my account, it's very shocking and amazing indeed. It makes no sense at all. They are destroying my life as we speak, I don't even know what to do and might be kicked out of my place where I stay. I'm considering the media and also legal action. They are taking advantage of the fact that I'm young and black.",1,1,"Good day Ali Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

On the 14th of January i transferred money to the Bidvest account which I sooner found out that it was a fraud account. On that same Saturday within 30 minutes of transection I went to the capitec branch to reverse the money of which was normal pay.  They made a recall and assured me that I will get a feed back within 7 days of working days. I never got any feed back so i went to the bank branch to check and they told me that the reversal wasn't processed because the recipient has already used the money. I asked to escalate the incident and the feedback was very disrespectful and unprofessional. How did the money got processed but i have reversed it after few minutes of transection!!!?

2023/02/10 14:49,John,Capitec Connect : Not quite Connected and some missing money,Capitec Connect Advertises cellular services that it does not provide. Capitec also deducts undisclosed fees and hides these amounts which do not appear on statements. Their Connect advertising promises a lot but they neglect to mention that their connectivity is limited to the outdated LTE. Their R5 SIM cost is accompanied by a R25  fee that is not mentioned upfront but more curiously it is not disclosed by the bank-staff or on its statements. What could amount to around 155MR is earning money for Capitec but what was this sneaky deduction and where is the money?

Yet Capitec still harasses the family for money which he had death cover. Last year SARS PAID money in and all of a sudden the money is gone, he has 2 children we provide for and taking his money is low and pathetic. Today my mom sent a message showing Capitec has handed him over to VVM. WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HE IS DEAD!!!!! Capitec has no morals or compassion for the death of a person. Now I will take this further as firstly money was taken from him and he is handed over. if you don't want to sort this out I will!!!!!!!!!",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/07 21:07,Olebogeng M,Unable to pay me back,"So after the run around of my situation regarding my fraud case that took place in July 2022. Capitec decided that they can't refund me the money I lost.
I mean for crying out loud, me and my friend had guns placed on our heads, we were forced to open our banking apps and provide pins to the criminals.

Then capitec tells me they can't refund me.
What's the use of having a banking app if our funds are not safe or there is no emergency or panic button when such is happening.
I would've understood if the agent told me that they reversed my funds same time I reported the issue but he or she failed.. I feel like capitec didn't even bother to listen to the recordings since well they say ""every call is recorded""

I have screenshots of where they state they can't refund me. I might as well move my savings to a new bank and close this useless account.",1,1,"Good day Olebogeng Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/07 19:50,Mandisa S,NOMFUNDO CAPITEC GHANDI DISRECTFUL AND RUDE CONSULTANT,"So today I went to the Ghandi Square Capitec branch to collect cash from an ATM, with electricity challenges and ATM's that are not functioning- there was a very long however I waited patiently for my turn. While we were waiting a lady by the name Landiwe came out from the branch to address us regarding the fact that the branch closes at 5:30 and unfortunately the ATMs will close-, people will have to go to other branches and I asked her that does she mean that regardless of the fact  an individual has been standing in the queue for more than half, she confirmed that yes and said if we are not happy we must lodge a complaint to the head office.10 to 15min later Nomfundo came out from the branch with the keys handy and said the branch is closing at 17:30 with thinking attitude
oh and she mentioned that the pple in front are lucky as they will get a chance to use the ATM, A gentleman said politely - sister I've been waiting here from 5pm and her response was that means you guys love this branch - there are many other branches so basically capitec is saying to me go to another branch and stand in another long QUEUE? That lady is very disrespectful and speaks to pple in a very unprofessional manner none the less maybe disrespect comes with the perks of client centricity from a Capitec customer service perspective. Anyway just after I was done, I went into the branch to take down the lady's names - I took down Landiwes name, she ddnt have any issues, Nomfundo was busy with a client at that time and from the distance I was standing her badge was clearly visible but because she has stinking attitude she stopped speaking to the client and gave me her names in full - in a very ****y voice and her told she doesn't have to give me her names in full, so she stopped assisting the client and exchanged words with me- well I'm not surprised poor customer service and disrespect is what she renders to clients. She was raising her voice in front of the client and threatening to press the panic button-for what reason? I do not know so I'm here with a concern and compliment that your very own employee showed me and the rest of the clients the true reflection of how CAPITEC teaches their employees to conduct themselves. I will be closing my capitec account and funeral policy and sure will be informing my husband to do the same- we are taking ur business to people who will appreciate the value that we add- look ill mannered employees should be least of your worries, you guys should be focusing on improving client experience and gaining more customers",1,1,"Good day Mandisa Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/07 18:19,Nomusa J,Disapointing service: Capitec at Phoenix branch,"I am highly disappointed and very engry at the service my mother received and this branch. Yesterday (6/2/2023) she deposited R2700 inside the bank because of one ATM that was working outside. However the money she deposited did not go through apparently the system was not working . I wander why was the money collected if they new the system is down. She was told to water for an hour so that it will reflect but it didn't she remained in ther for 4hrs with no help until they closed she was told to come back today,  she has been at the branch from 9:00am till they closed at 18h00 with no luck of getting her money back, she has been asking for reversal but they refused to do it. It is very hurting that you can keep someone who is almost 60yrs at the branch the whole day with no help, I don't even want to know what the manager tried to do in this matter. It is a pity that I leave far from my mother but I would of drove to this **** branch and gave them a peace of my mind.",1,1,"Good day Nomusa Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

They then told her that the money will be transferred back into her account within 24/48 hours or 7 days and that she would have to pay a dispute fee if they are unsuccessful in reversing the money
, despite the fact that this was not her fault and rather the fault of the weak security that capitec has in place for their clients

Ontop of all of this she also has to pay to make her a new card after capitec blocked the card

I received the initial response from Capitec agent Silindile Mchunu on the 21st of December 2022, who escalated the matter to the Deceased Estate Department. However, to date I've not had any additional feedback from them at all regarding the resolution of this matter.

While I am a fan of Capitec and their services in general, I am very disappointed in the lack of service received in this particular matter. I've no idea what the issue might be - if I had, this matter would not have ended up on Hello Peter in the first place.

I submitted my claim and only to find out it never reached the so called head office, this being told by an uninterested CS agent over the phone and then being told I have to submit the claim again. Fortunately for me I was being assisted by a wonderful person at the branch who escalated the matter to the branch manager of which both if them handled the situation. I thought my troubles were over when the claim was finally approved and to think I only had a mere 4 months left to pay so it wasn't going to coz capitec that much to pay off my claim. Little did I know that was the start of all my troubles , I noticed my credit score going down due to some missed payments only to find out the insurance was not paying in time. The most fustrating thing is they assured me this would not happen, as a job seeker especially in the financial sector you rely on your score for jobs now that has been messed up and to top it of I'm still apperantly owing a further amount of which I don't understand. This has been the worst thing and as much as Capitec has had bad reviews on their loans I thought this would not happen to me haha jokes on me.

2023/02/04 22:25,Noluthando M,Very bad service,"On the 9th of January I went to make an atm cash deposit to my personal account at Capitec situated at Fairbridge Mall in Brackenfell. I deposited an amount of R4900 into the ATMs cassette, the ATM took the money and started to make sounds as if it was counting the money. The ATM then went blank and said it was out of order, it restarted, I went into the branch to ask 1 of the staff members to come and assist me. When we got to the ATM it had restarted and was working perfectly, she provided me with the ATM number. I launched an enquiry at the bank and was given a reference number. The person said this usually happens when there is loadshedding where the system loses connection. I asked them if they could check the camera footage to see I did deposit money into the ATM.

2 Days after the incident, I went to enquire what had happened, they said their IT department could not find fault or an ATM error on their logs. They will log a swap where a 3rd party company will come in and take the money for counting to see if there are any discrepancies in the amounts. On Friday they gave me feedback to say there were no discrepancies and the claim was unsuccessful. On their side they don't see the amount and they will not further investigate.

This shows poor service delivery on their side as such an amount can not just disappear from the ATM. If the 3rd party could not find the amount then where did it go as the branch claims there is no one that has access to the ATM cassette once money has been placed in the ATM. 
I won't lie I am very disappointed by the whole incident.",1,1,"Good day Noluthando Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/04 18:22,Mavis V,Capitec bank demolished my name,"I took Capitec bank personal loan 2018. To cut the long story short, I fell pregnant then I called Capitec bank to inform them that I would not be able to pay according to our agreement. As my salary would drop due to some allowances cut off they told me to go to the branch. I went to one of their branch at Gauteng and even went to Secunda branch to explain my situation. I even took doctor's letter as my pregnancy was already showing as proof and a letter from work as proof also. At Secunda the lady that assisted me sent an email of my documents and even called them same applies to Gauteng branch the guy made a phone call without any help. Afterwards I received calls from Capitec bank about payment but I would explain same thing everytime (I wanted to make new payment arrangement). Then I received a call from Vertex they said they were calling on behalf of Capitec bank. They said I have to make payment arrangement with them. Which I did, I paid Vertex up to date.  Now I went for home loan which I qualified for but now they told me I am under dept counselling which I didn't know (Vertex) and I still owe Capitec bank according to their check. It seems like now I have two accounts that I am owing with different amounts. By the time I agree to payment arrangement with Vertex I thought it was Capitec bank dept since they called on behalf of Capitec bank. Honestly I don't know Vertex. When I go to Capitec bank (Secunda branch) Vertex does reflect on my account. My home loan (the bank) only wanted paid up letter from Capitec so that it would be a prove that I owe Vertex only. Capitec bank failed to give me that letter, I've been paying Capitec bank in vain now I pay Vertex and my name has been ruined. I NEED MY NAME CLEANED. Please help, Capitec I've been paying you for years. I've never run away from my dept nor ignore phone calls from Capitec bank. I am always cooperating. I made means to go to branches to sort this out. In all my dept I am a very good payer, I even make advance payment",1,1,"Good day Mavis Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/03 11:43,Loo L,Capitec FRAUDS,Don’t trust ATM deposit machines or your money with capitec ever!!!! They have a new scam where as you deposit your money into the ATM they have the guards from the ATM sneak in at the back of the ATM while you are making a cash deposit and cancel your transaction in the middle of a deposit!!!! They then make you file a dispute and wait 24 hours for your money which the ATM has now taken only to leave you with thousands of rands missing!!! Do not trust capitec with your money especially cash I repeat this has happened to me twice now including 3 friends that I know of. Do not trust capitec with your money and do not trust their ATMs. Be aware of the scams which are taking place inside of the banks robbing people of their money and withholding money that you should be trusting with a bank. I repeat do not trust capitec with your money in any way shape or form they have other ways where they steal your money from your account on multiple occasions. I hope this message reaches the right people and you decide to close your accounts with capitec immediately. Stealing is stealing and if they did it to me and others they will do it again and again and again !!!!,1,1,"Good day LooThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/02/02 17:15,Dikeledi,Embarrassed account holder,"It makes me feel really uncomfortable to send this kind of email, but I feel compelled to do so given the absurd occurrences I've had to deal with in relation to this bank. Noting that I have been a customer of this bank for many years, this year has been so disappointing ever since the beginning of March when I became unemployed and until now, I have reported a case of fraud in my account which no successful resolution, been wrongfully funneled with three months' worth of back-to-back calls and emails, and not to mention that no one from the contact center, despite how educated and skilled they are, failed to inform me about the unemployment/incapacitate to fund debt as per insurance claim or to freeze my account for three months until I secure placement and to notify me of it. Worse of everything is that when the loan was taken I was on contract and I'm still on contract by my loan is scheduled over the prescribed term which really makes me worried. I don't know who registered me as a permanent employee because that's false!

This statement is even more egregious because my accounts are presently being rescheduled, and the updated/rescheduled policy was implemented with higher and more interest than what I originally signed for. 

I've been going back and forth to the branch and circling the block with these cases/matters, and the pressure is too much for me to bear. I would like this account to be scratched off due to the irregularities found from your unbarring and horribly/improperly mismanaged services. As a single parent and mother of two, I am finding this process difficult and exhausting to deal with. I genuinely think I have been patient enough, but I can't take the poor service I have received so over past six months.

The latest is I now have to wait 14 days for it to be resolved with fidelity who will do a reconciliation and if there is a surplus will reimburse me.

2023/02/02 06:50,Salome,Don't give a S*** for fraud being reported,"There is fraud on my account and after calling them 2 times they say it is not fraud and they want me take my time to sort it out. 

My account was depit ordered from Vodacom. I called the helpline to get it sorted they told me that Vodacom - whom I am not a client with. According to the operator Vodacom gives depit orders thru to Capitec and they just load the Debit order. Capitec are not given any information with regard to the person's requesting the debit order nor the document which gives the consent thus they are not verifying that it is MY request yet they allow this to be deducted from my account. I asked them to get it sorted and then they insisted that I have to sort it out myself with Vodacom.... 

I cannot believe that the bank that prides itself on being safe can allow a debit order to go off anyone's account without even being able to verify the person requesting the debit order to be actually their client.  

I also tried to log a fraud ticket with them which they insisted are not their mistake.

2023/02/01 15:37,Rowena F,Poor servicve provide by my bank Capitec Bank,I had an awful experience with capitec bank as a customer of theirs on the 29th of jan 2023 i made a cashsend from my cell phone app to a capitec beneficiary unfortunately it happenf that I accidently swaped two of the numbers of the persons cell phone number and the money ended up in the wrong account. i tried calling the person but with no luck the phone was on voicemail on monday the 30th jan 2023 i called the capitec customer service explaining what happened the consultant also tried calling the recipient but also couldn't reach the person than suggested i open a case against the recipient which i felt was ridiculous because how do you open a case against a cellphone number of a person that was placed incorrect on the 31st Jan 2023 i went to the Vanderbijlpark branch and the consultant called the head office just to be told exactly the same nonsense as a client i feel like closing my account with immediate effect due to the poor service i received from my bank. I feel as my bank there must be something they can do to retrieve my money back as this person is a capitec customer aswell i was in no position to hear that i should open a case which i was going to loose in anyway no person in this lifetime would answer their call or even admit to receiving money from an unknown person. I had a similar case with Absa bank a few years ago and without hassle they reversed my money back into my account this is not a small amount of money that was send an amount of R1400 was send to this person that i just have to write off because of a stupid bank that cant help their clients. I AM PLEADING with hello peter to assist me with this matter because at this point i feel like closing the account and take it to another bank that's more competent. I have a family to feed with that money that they just feel i should write off due to my mistake that i have made PLEASE PLEASE help me sort out this mess Thank you,1,1,"Good day Rowena Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I need your assistance, last year I paid the school kids before the end of the year and the schools advised me to stop the debit orders(not Debi check), because it will continue to deduct, I then went to the Capitec branch and stopped the 2 debit orders, the consultant at the branch advised me that I have to come back to the branch this year to activate it again, I went to one of your branches in East London Eastern Cape, explained the situation to the consultant and requested for the debit orders to be activated, but the consultant advised me that I don't have to activate it, I see now on the app that it(Port Rex High and Crewe Primary School) is showing under stopped debit orders, so that means that if the schools want to debit tomorrow it won't go through.....I explained everything in detail to your consultant, but she told me it doesn't need to be activated?

Please assist urgently, because if the debit order doesn't go through then the agreement I have with the schools will be cancelled and I'll be held liable for charges?

Please refund me my R36160 as well as the fees of R37.75 that I incurred because of these unauthorised transactions.

I am unhappy and disappointed with the service and the amount of time it is taking for Capitec to resolve this matter.  I have been going back and forth the branch to get feedback since November 2022 and till today I am told that the matter is still being investigated.

I would not recommend clients to keep lump sums of their hard earned money in their Capitec accounts because there is no sense of urgency when assisting clients with important issues like the one I am experiencing.",1,1,"Good day ZephaniaThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I usually do this at the atm but because of the line, i asked the lady at the front if I could be assisted inside and she said NO i have to wait in the line. It didn't make sense to me until my gf just walked past her and went to the self service station and we got what we needed. When i asked this lady at the front she says SHE THOUGHT i wanted one without an address.

She was in such a rush to sit down and gossip with her friend, she's not focussed on work, she's thinking about other things rather than working.

She's not getting paid to think, especially to think on behalf of the customer. She's getting paid to work and listen. Not to THINK.

I didn't get her name, but she's at Capitec Randridge Mall, she has glasses and a Afro.

Before coming to work she must leave all her thoughts at home.

2023/01/30 23:58,Nancy,Don't bank with Capitec,"SO Disappointed with Capitec Bank, 2 weeks ago I had my account defrauded. 

Transaction 1: R7483.00 successful
Transaction 2: R1212.00 successful
Transaction 3: AED950 unsuccessful 
Transaction 4: AED530 unsuccessful 
Transaction 5: AED430 unsuccessful 

The above amounts were taken out of my account and the other which were unsuccessful were due to my limit being reached so they were declined.

Money was taken out of my credit card. I called the call center 3 times only to be pushed from pillar to post and having to explain myself over and over. When speaking to the call center they originally told me that the card was swiped in dubai, i said its impossible as i was in Durban. The lady insisted that i swiped the card. I eventually got so annoyed that I went into the bank and sat in front of a consultant. The consultant called the call center and explained the same story and once again they told him that the client swiped the card, his answer to her was she is sitting in front of me and I have her card. Again she said it was done at 09h05 in the morning and it is now 11h05, he said it still impossible for her to have made her way from Dubai to South Africa in such a short time. The call center eventually said they will investigate and get back to me. 

At the time of notifying the bank the payments were all still in the processing stage, I asked if they can stop the transactions and he said that the fraud department wld look into it and refund me as the transaction look suspicious.

The fraud department looked into the transactions and refunded the money back to me 2 days later, I was so grateful. BUT THEN day 3 the money was taken back by Capitec saying that the payments were done online and not swiped so it didn't matter if I was in Durban or anywhere else. Again I told them I didn't make any payments to any Dubai merchant. I told them if I had done an online payment the app wld have asked me to approve the payments which I didn't get anything. Then they said I put my card details in and again I told them I didn't and if I did I wldnt be reporting this as fraud.

Right now they have closed this case and refused to reopen it as they say I spent the money. Which I didn't as you can clearly see there was a problem on my account with all the foreign payments trying ro go off but being declined. 

So disappointing that money can be taken out your account and the bank just doesn't care. Well I care and this is alot of money. I am again going to try and query this and try get my money back. If not I am going to have no choice to take it further to the ombudsman.",1,1,"Good day Client Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Last week my bank double debited an amount and later credited my account on the same day leaving my account with insufficient funds at the time for my loan with capitec.  I called in twice and spoke to 2 incompetent people .One named jennifer and another idiot who both assured me the debit went off and I should ignore the messages and mails. Today I called again after receiving more harassment and spoke to another incompetent person requesting to speak to a supervisor because I  can't keep dealing with idiots. The last simpleton I spoke to was Xonani who haven't asked his supervisor to call me back to arrange the repayment as requested. According to Xonani who's quite the arrogant idiot, despite what his colleagues said he wanted to know what my bank statement said? Not realising I DID check it hence the reason for me calling twice.
I called in later to make an arrangement because Xonani is clearly incompetent and thankfully an arrangement was made .

2023/01/29 15:37,Cindy K,Capitec Bank accepts fraud being commited on my account,"I relocated to the UAE in Feb 2022 but still have a Capitec Bank account in SA for when I go there to visit family. I noticed fraud being committed on my bank account. Yet it is impossible for me to get hold of Capitec Bank in any way, shape, or form from the UAE. I have literally tried every phone number provided on my bank card and the internet, none of which work. I tried to contact them via whatsup, as their website suggests. Unfortunately this medium of communication is a robot and does not respond to anything I say or ask, believe me I tried just basic commands like: ""Account"", ""Assistance"", ""Fraud"", ""Help"" etc etc. None of which work. It just keeps on replying saying, I do not understand.

In the end I had no option but to ask a family member to physically go to a Capitec branch in SA explaining my situtation and ask for urgent assistance. He was told that I must phone the International customer care number +**********7. Do you know how many times I tried to do that (before my family member even went to the bank)? The number doesn't work!!! He even phoned the number from his cellphone while inside the branch in SA and guess what, the number didn't work. The capitec person then dialed the number from her capitec landline and handed the phone to him, he explained that there is fraud being commited on my bank account and asked for assistance, I can not get hold of anyone, can someone maybe contact me via phone, email, whatsup anything. But No, he was told that the only way a complaint can be logged is by myself on the customer care nr +**********7 (You know the one that doesn't work). So according to Capitec they have no problem with fraud being commited on their clients bank accounts and they won't lift a finger to assist you, even though you can't get hold of them!",1,1,Good day CindyWe acknowledge receipt of your query and have assigned your matter to a designated official.

2023/01/27 19:14,Sibusiso N,Capitec Bank doesn't care at all.,"I'm a Capitec Bank client, recently withdrew R900 from an ABSA ATM since Capitec Bank ATMs are always full of don't have cash. It was on the 14th of January 2023 at Lyttelton Shopping Centre. I made a mistake by taking time in taking the cash from the machine until the machine reversed the cash back inside. I didn't know what to do after that, because I needed to send the money to someone. I had to withdraw again R900 so I could send the money. Later I called Capitec Bank client services to report my problem. They said I don't have to go to ABSA Bank because ABSA can't help me. They will investigate from their end with ABSA. Since then everyday I've been following up with the investigation through their WhatsApp number tracking system. Today when I checked I got a response to say I have no incident in the past 90 days. Called their client service center again, they told me the got a response from ABSA saying the transaction was successful meaning I withdrew R900 twice while. Now I'm defeated.

2023/01/27 10:34,Shoni,I feel scammed,"Capitec are scammers. I got my salary on Monday and transferred the money into my kids account under the same capitec main account, then the balance that was left on my savings account was around R818, then I tried making a payment of R500 to my uncle of which I got an error that connection is lost, I tried for the second time and still received the same error (connection lost), BUT this time around the balance was now R300 something rands, which means the R500 went out of my account. My uncle who also banks with Capitec, called as he never received the money, I told him it went out of my account, so we waited 2 hours and still did not received it, I then had to send him the R500 out of my kids account which he confirmed that he received and also told him that if he gets the first payment, he must let me know, which he still confirm that he never received after a few days and that money is not back in my account. I then did a bank statement so that I can see what happened to my money and to my surprise, it doesn't even show on the statement that the was payment done and money went out of my account. I went to Capitec to get answers and instead they are showing me my bank statement that no money was out of my account.

I go in and tell them the ATM doesn't want to take my card, I don't even get it push it in or anything. No I now have to get a new card (the black one) because my chip is damaged which is not true because he works everywhere else except at the ATM, My card would have expired in Nov of this year then I would have got a new one but not being able to withdraw money from the ATM is inconvenient for me, I feel it is not my fault that they new fancy counters can't take the old cards. Now I had to pay for a new card. Instead they could have just gave everyone the black card when they put in the new ATM because how many other people don't also struggle with their gold cards at the ATM and then they have to pay for a new card?

I checked this morning and saw that the loan debit order has been processed on my account and yet I get arrears messages.

Went to mtn and they said not their issue. Called client care again and after arguing and telling the consultant that I.T dept must look into this they did so...came back to me after 4 min of listening to ****py hip hop music and said that the two purchases was within 1 second of each other.

Myself and my partner separated and I did the honest thing to make qnd arrangement which thabo said it is no use as this doesnt help so he cant understand why I pay that if it is not what I need to pay in the first place. He even asked why did a take money if I am not willing to pay ! I pay what i can afford and he made me feel so unworthy and hia comments is absurd ! I requested a call recording and he said no they can't ... As a mother with two kids I feel sooo violated after that phonecall and Thabo and his teamleader both were so rude and have no mercy as to what any person is going through . . Even went so far to ask me in detail why myself and my partner seperated...i am so disgusted by both of them And I have been banking with them since 2013 , but now I feel like I no longer want to bank with them if this is how they treat their clients....",1,1,"Good day Anika Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/26 07:37,amanda K,CAPITEC BANK IS NOT POPI COMPLIANT/CLIENTS DETAILS ARE BEING SHARED TO THE OUTSIDERS,"A fraudulent activity took place with my identity number and a contract phone was opened under my name and capitec bank account.I disputed the debit order, got in contact with the netword service provider and they confirm there is a contract active under my name.I escalated it as a fraudulent activity that has taken place under my details, i filled in all the paper work sent to me by service provider, went to the polisce station for an avidavit.The service provider discovered that indeed it was a fraudulent activity, the party used my id number , my names but with a different face on the id.I received a report on my credit report to say that on the 27th October 2022 thre was a Hard Seearc Done by Capitec before a Credit Check was done by the Network service Provider of which the contact was activated on the 21st Novermber 2022.I went to The capitec Bank in Gugulethu Mall  next to Shoporight branch no 2247 Cape Town to enquire about this ""HARD SEARCH"" that was done on my name and was not aware about it.I explained to the manager what took place against my identity and asked what type of ""hard Search "" was done ?She said called her IT and came back to me and said they do not see anything, i had to show her mt report from Clear Score and my credit score Came down because of that and the Contract phone account.The manager then told me she will  call again onother IT deoartment and came back to me telling me two different things of which i thing she herself did not understand.At first she told me that because I was in teh branch transfering funds hence i received that notification about ""Hard Search"" I told her it was the firts time to receive such notification.Seconly she told me there was a glinch on the system at the time and the IT department have updated by profile again removing the ""Hard Search"" That was too confusing for herself.My understanding is that a ""credit Search/hard seach is done when a clien is looking into oepning a contract/take a loan/take a credit card to see if they qualify.I then spoke to a consaltant because i was not happy with the response.the consultant thenpcked up on the 27th October 2022  yes i was in the branch to transfer Funds and i was assisted by Mr Mkhaza Mkaza then on that same day a credit check was done of which i never asked the consultant to checjk anything as i was not looking open any thing.Next Month a Phone Contract is activated under my details.Why did Capitec not sent me a Debicheck to ask permision for the debit order?I need an investigation to take place because this is indicating that my details were given to an outsider to use my identity.HOW MANY CONTRACTS WILL BE OPEN UNDER MY DETAILS?Thank God the Network service provider manage to pick this up and to rectify it on their side.My concern is CAPITEC CONSULTANTS WHO ARE BUSY ON THEIR CELL PHONES WHILE ON DUTY.That celary shows that we ARE NOT SAFE BECAUSE THEY CAN GIVE OUT DETAILS TO ANYONE OUTSIDE.I HAVE OPENED A CASE REGARDING THIS MATTER AND I HAVE A CASE NO.TODAY I AM A VICTIM OF FRAUD BECAUSE OF YOU BEING NEGLEJENT.I NEED A RESPONSE NO LATER BY TODAY AND TELL ME WHAT TYPE  ""HARD SEARCH"" WAS DONE UNDER MY CREDIT PROFILE AND WHY A MONTH LATER A CONTARCT PHPNE WAS OPENED UNDER MY DETAILS.",1,1,"Good day amanda Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

Couple of days later i go back to capitec and I'm told an account linked to mine was suspected to have committed fraud hence the blockage of my account, i was told i had to bring an ID copy and an affidavit explaining why a certain amount of money was sent to me in order for my account to be active again. What puzzles me about this case is that, capitec investigated their client, found she wasn't guilty for anything then they unblocked her account but for some reason i still have to explain the money i recieved from the client whom they have resolved the case with. Firstly Capitec did not notify me about anything pertaining to a fraud and my account being blocked before they even did it i had to go find out for myself, secondly capitec resolves the issue they had with their client and unblocks their account but they will not unblock my account because i am still expected to explain, explain what and why exactly? Because the issue has been resoved, why am i still an accomplice to a solved ""crime"", why did capitec not ask their suspected client all these questions and let them be the one doing all the explaining and affidavits?

I call capitec this morning and speak to a lady by the name of Samantha Van Schalkwyk and she tells  she can’t help me I must call eskom and then when I asked for the number she didn’t have one. So this person and capitec expect me the client to call Eskom’s 5000 different departments to hopefully get help from eskom how pathetic? So what do we pay the service fee for? The day before payday capitec steals my last money and now wants me to call eskom to get it back. This is honestly a bubblegum operation here because even if you pay an account incorrectly, you must go to small claims court, they can’t even give your your own money back that’s in their system.

I need that account for petty cash, I need it to be opened and show me any rule that says my account must be blocked for transactions that are not even on my statement.

I called your Complaints Management line which only put me through to Client Care, and spoke to Valiswa & Mulanga. Mulanga informed me about Capitec tracking clients' accounts, etc. What is the POPIA saying about this? Who authorized Capitec to invade customer's accounts with their stupid Algorithm or tracking device or whatever they call it, and gave permission them to do whatever they want at any time? Why do you track my account if my account with you is not in arrears? Why do you deduct before the date that we have an agreement for? Capitec does not trust me enough to wait for the date that we agreed on before making a move on my account? What if there was no money in my account? What about the plans that I had for the money that Capitec deducted from my account as if it was the right thing to do? If I reverse the transaction, who is going to pay the reversal charges? Is it a CRIME for me to have money in my account before pay day? THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE,!!! I have lodged a complaint with their complaints management, I know they will NOT help OR they may CLAIM to have tried to CALL me, which is likely to be FALSE. I have been treated this way before by Capitec. NO WONDER THERE ARE SO MANY UNHAPPY CAPITEC CUSTOMERS ON HELLOPETER, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT CLIENTS- MAYBE THEY HAVE REACHED THEIR TARGETS!!!",1,1,"Good day Clara Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/24 09:47,Jessica B,BANKING APP FRAUD,"On the 3rd of January 2023, my phone was stolen. My husband blocked my phone and I went to Capitec to stop my Banking App.  A large amount of money had already been transferred from my access facility into my savings account, then from my savings account into another individual's account.  My phone security plus my banking app security was hacked. All this took pIace in under 90 minutes.  Capitec advised me that I had to the go to SAPs to open up a case, get a case number and an affidavit. I submitted the required documents to Capitec's fraud department to do their investigation. This investigation took roughly 14 working days. 
SAPS also conducted an investigation of their own and after roughly 14 days, I got a message from SAPS saying that my case was closed as all possible leads had been followed up. 
I went to Capitec Bank on the 18th January to follow up with them as I had received a message from SAPS. The lady that had previously helped me, said it was strange that SAPS sent the message as they did not make any contact with Capitec bank.
I received a phone call from Capitec's fraud department on Thursday the 19th of January regarding the money taken from my account. The outcome of the investigation by Capitec Fraud Department was that the amount that was transferred from my account had then been transferred into 3 other accounts and was not recoverable. 
Capitec is holding me liable for the stolen funds plus interest.
Capitec clients are vulnerable - I am the victim of a crime but I am being victimised.
On 20th January I submitted a complaint request to the Banking Ombudsman - to date I am still waiting for a response.",1,1,"Good day Jessica Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I got the PDF and emailed it to the person who helped me who is Didintle Mokushane who works at the fruad department, and ever since I haven't got any feedback, when I call capitec they say there is no incident under my name, which is worrying because last time I checked they gave me a reference number for the case I opened, and now when I try to get that reference number on your WhatsApp platform it says ""No incidents reported in the last 90 days"" which is awkward for me because you did gave me and yet you say I don't have any incident.

What I know is that this matter was forwarded to the fraud department of Capitec, and now its the 5th day and the money is still not reflecting in my account, when I go to the App it says unprosceesed transaction.

I really do not understand how you guys treat us as your clients we give you all the necessary documents and yet still you guys say I haven't opened any reports under my account.

Please help out guys I can't even sleep properly beacsue of you guys, we are your clients you should put us first because without us there is no business for you guys.

I have become a victim of online fraud. Called the call centre on the 6th Jan 2023 to stop my card used for fraudulent online activity. Card was stopped I called later the same day to confirm its been cancelled. 9th Jan got a new card and on 14th Jan fraud activity continues from the card that was stopped on the 6th Jan. Logged a complaint with reference **********26 and given incorrect turn around for feedback, mind you cards cancelled again including the new card. Followed up again on 18 Jan spoke to the manager Dimakatso that gave the poorest of poor service for a manager,disgusting! She apprenently escalated and said feedback will be received in 2 working days. Here we are at 23rd Jan nooo feedback no acknowledgement NOTHING. So again I call capitec and speak to Clint who then advises the old card was cancelled on the 6th Jan but not unenrolled on the system. Does that put me liable to these charges made with a card that capitec advised was cancelled, twice in one day by 2 different consultants. Mind the way I was given the run around calling through, like a base of hot potato on the 14th Jan, 8 calls later a consultant assisted me only... disgusting service. 14th Samantha told me feedback in 1 day (not working days)nothing, on 18th Dimakatso feedback in 2 days for escalation, nothing. 23rd Clint please send me a sms or email as confirmation of our call, nothing.

2023/01/20 12:22,Sue H,Capitec Proof of Payments,"We received a proof of payment from Capitec and unfortunately the payer used our own company as a reference number so we couldn't find out who actually paid us. I phoned the customer care dept of Capitec to see if they could find out who the Transaction ID belongs to so I can allocate the payment correctly.
They couldn't pick up who made that payment at all. 
Why do you even use a transaction ID if you cannot identify who it belongs too????
Please make the name of the payer mandatory on your proof of payments. They are a complete waste of time and energy if not traceable.

2023/01/19 16:54,Innocent M,Way forward.,"July 2022 my sister who is a travel agent had a written agreement with a group, whom I gave cencent to use my account.  Unfortunately things did not go well between them as per thier agreement and because of that the group reported fraudulent and my account was closed. 
My sister and I went to the nearest branch to sort out the matter and we were told to bring an affidavit which we did. A few days later I went to the bank to find out if the matter was sorted and it was not .
After my account was closed two payments were made in that account and now the bank is keeping those payments which has nothing to do with what was reported and while they are keeping it away from me they are accessing it because when I check on the whatsapp the amount that was in the account when it was being closed its not the same as now.
I think it's only fair that they open the account and let them sort it out between themselves since they have a written agreement. Because when the group made a cancelation and released that they had to pay a cancelation fee that's when the reported. 
The two payments that was payed into my account was from sassa which I use to pay for my child's day care . So I really need those funds .

So I want to know what's going to happen now since no one is calling to ask questions on the matter. I also don't mind submitting that written agreement so that they can understand the matter further.

I received sms notifications for international purchases to the value of R10 244.00 I only received 3 alerts where I had to enter my code and that was for a small amount. as for the big amounts no alerts came through for me to approve. This is beyond shocking that someone could actually use my account details to purchase items. I want this investigated. I had to block my card and I'm pretty sure that I will have to pay for a new card now. I was charged for this transactions and I want this reversed.

2023/01/19 09:30,Denise A,Capitec reported fraud,"My son who banks with Capitec was scammed through Facebook Marketplace when he was purchasing a TV for sale.  The scammer had hacked a good friend of the family’s facebook account pretending to be Mr McFarlane, however, it was not Mr McFarlane that we he was dealing with, we found out today that this scammer has now just defrauded another victim who is a friend of Mr McFarlane.

My son Mr Dylan David Abbott went to Capitec Rand Ridge Mall last Saturday morning the 14th Jan ’23 to lodge this case of fraud.  He took his copy of his certified ID as well as a stamped police affidavit as well as the case no from Honeydew Police Station – Case no:  210/1/2023 – Capitec Ref no:  **********13.

He was then notified by SMS the following day (Sunday) around midday that unfortunately his fraud dispute was unsuccessful and that all funds have been utilized and that he must take up the matter with SAPS.  I find this hard to believe that this fraud case could have been investigated within a couple of hours as Capitec Randridge Mall closes at 1 on a Sat and is not open on a Sunday.  Normally fraud cases take quite sometime to investigate.  HOW DO WE KNOW THAT IN FACT SOMETHING WAS DONE ABOUT THIS AND WHERE IS THE PROOF THAT THESE DEFRAUDED FUNDS HAVE TRIED TO BE RECOVERED TO MR ABBOTT’S ACCOUNT?

These funds were paid into a Tyme Bank account – account no:  **********9 – an amount of R4 700.00 (scammer’s account).  Mr Abbott is not the only one who has been scammed through this same Tyme Bank account – the scammer also indicated that he had an ABSA account as well as the Tyme Bank account and that either account could be used – ABSA Account No:  **********.
The response received from Capitec has been virtually nothing - surely a fraud line should be taking these scammers very seriously.  
In addition to this, we spent a lot of time at Honeydew Police Station reporting this case of fraud.  My son took all the requested documents from the Capitec fraud line with him to the branch in Randridge Mall, these were not kept on record by your branch but given back to my son to take home – what was the point of that, surely you should be keeping these on record?
I have been sending e-mails to the Client Care Centre and info@ombud since Monday and absolutely no phone call or return e-mail whatsoever.  Yesterday I then e-mailed forensics and had a response this morning saying the following:  ""Please note that account has been placed on HOLD
Please confirm before COB , if no feedback is received the HOLD will be removed"" - WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN - We are the ones expecting feedback?

2023/01/18 21:52,Willize L,Capitec ruining my credit record,"Last year I had to battle to apply for an increase on my credit card and due to the incompetence of Durban Capitec Branches, I even got blocked for Fraud Alert. Luckily Harrismith Capitec sorted everything out for me and it was smooth sailing for a while.

Then after about 2 months (just after MFC approved me for a new car) I got a notice letter that my access loan is now decreased by 50%. Which in principle I'm fine with but what is trully upsetting is that not only am I seeing now that apparently I missed a payment on my Access Loan in September but also my credit usage is now through the roof (more than 100%) because Capitec lowered my Access Loan lower than what is outstanding. This happened without reason and without giving me an option to appeal or disagree with this decision. 

Due to Capitec my credit rating is curently down from 655 to 622 and I have not missed a payment in 6 months but yet again due to Capitec my credit report reads that I have. Since my previous complaint on HelloPeter was never taken further, does Capitec even bother trying to help unhappy customers or is customer service something from the past?",1,1,"Good day Willize Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/18 19:34,Zintle M,No professionalism. No compassion for the elderly,"I am very unhappy with the service Capitec offers their elderly clients. They have no comparison whatever. My mother is gravely ill. She can't walk let alone for anything for herself. Her Capitec card is not regarding on any ATM or speedpoint device and required a new card. My sister went to Capitec to seek assistance and she was told by the official that they would have to visit her at home to witness that she is honestly and truly ill. We waited. Nothing happened. After giving up,  we had no choice but to move my bedridden mother from her home to Capitec to attempt getting assistance as she required to withdraw money for her medication. I personally took her to the bank with the assistance of neighbours and had to request Uber to and from which was an unnecessary expense. The neighbours carried her inside the branch where she had to use a fingerprint to withdraw money but still a new card was not issued. The Capitec official said he explained to my sister at her time of visiting the branch to enquire about my mother's situation that they would have to send an email to Capitec Head Office authorising them to visit my mom at home and issue a new card. He also said that the email had been sent. Up until now my mom still has not received a new card and no Capitec official has made an attempt to visit my mom at home as per agreement. Another month is approaching. Does this mean that my neighbours and I have to carry her out of bed into Uber from Uber carry her into the branch and repeat the cycle again going home? These are unnecessary costs which could easily be avoided if Capitec staff could be professional just for once and care for the elderly. They maybe old but they're clients too and they need to be treated as such.",1,1,"Good day Zintle Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/17 19:39,Keanu F,False Fraud Case,"On the 13th of January 2023 I logged into my Capitec application only to find that my savings account is missing. Everything including payment history was missing, in a panic I contacted the bank to find out what is going on.

Bank tells me that I was reported for fraud and they have locked my account indefinitely ?

I asked the customer support agent to notify me of when this transaction took place so that I could back track and see who the person was that made a false fraudulent case against me.

I managed to track the person and confronted the woman about the false claim she has reported to her bank (FNB) stating I scammed her out of R1770 of crypto. 

She eventually responded and provided me with the affidavit showing that she did not report me but has made a case against a scammer that was opperating on Facebook. 

In the affidavit is clearly states that she bought the crypto from me and a few weeks later someone contacted her on Facebook regarding some sort of deal where she can sell their products if she sends them 100$ of crypto. She sent the amount to the scammer and they ran of with the funds unfortunately.

FNB somehow thought I was the one that commited the crime even after the woman stated in her affidavit that she only got the crypto from me and proceed to notify Capitec that I had committed fraud regarding that transaction.

Capitec without any hesitation, froze my savings account and have no notification to me when this has done. Not thinking twice to read through the affidavit the woman provided FNB.

I ran around going to the Capitec branch and the police station providing all the information they needed, showing the chat logs between myself and this woman, the emails where she stated I had nothing to do with this, proof that she got what she paid for via the platform and even proof of her emailing FNB and the investigator to drop all the charges but nothing has been done.

Going on day five now of needing to ask family and friends for money to get food, electricity and water. I'm unable to work and continue to call Capitec each and every day explaining the situation only to be told that they are investigating the matter.

What are they investigating? The proof has been provided and I got falsely accused of fraud by FNB and yet Capitec does not care about the fact that I don't have a cent on my name.

I suggest those that use Capitec to use this information as a eye opener, Capitec will freeze your account without any hesitation if someone falsely reports you for fraud.",1,1,"Good day KeanuThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/17 12:22,Johan,NO response and NO resolve from Capitec Bank,"On 22 December 2022 I purchased prepaid electricity through the Capitec Bank internet banking portal like I have done before. I received the SMS with the token number, but on pinning in the given token number no Units were loaded or added to my existing balance. There was also no error indication on the Meter. I tried the same pin again without success. I phoned the Capitec Bank number provided in the SMS **********) and spoke to one of the consultants, tried the token pin again with the consultant on the line, still no success. The consultant then informed me that the issue will be escalated and ""they"" will get back to me within 48 hours, which didn't happen. Today is 17 January 2023, I phoned again on 9 Jaunuary 2023, and again today, AGAIN told that they will escalate the issue and let me know within 48 hours? REALLY????

I managed to find and directly contact the (supposed) service provider, who immediately escalated it from their side (and THANK YOU GRC Revenue Management for your quick response - MUCH appreciated) and  forwarded me these responses from Cigi Cell: ""hi. This transaction was not done via us. it was done via Easypay and they have the meter linked to British Xabaya. Customer needs to log a query with capitec who needs to escalate to Easypay for resolution"". I am informed by the service provider that the meter is wrongly linked (to British Xabaya?) and should be linked to GRC Revenue Management?

2023/01/17 11:43,Randy P,"Fraudulent card disputes, waiting 3 months","I called Capitec on the 31st of October 2022 to report fraudulent activity on my card. The person I spoke to confirmed the amounts and dates when the fraudulent purchases were being made and then said I would get a call within 5 working days. Guess what ? I didn't.... 

I then called again on 8 November 2022 to follow up and was told I just needed to wait and someone will get in touch with me. 

No one did and I eventually forgot to follow up again as I work a full time job and have other priorities other than chasing after my own money. 

I eventually called again on 10 December 2022 just to be told that my case has been closed due to the amounts and dates of the fraudulent purchases not being confirmed. Basically saying that it took a whole month for Capitec to just confirm that!?  WOW. 

The issue was then escalated on 29 December 2022 and everything logged again on 30 December . 

Getting through to Capitec is already a nightmare, having to call numerous times before someone actually answers with the hope of them not dropping the line. 

I got through to someone today and was told to call ********** as this is the number for card disputes. Guess what ? It's not! It just redirected me to client care where the advisor told me that card disputes don't even take calls. 

In conclusion, I was told that I need to wait 30 days from the 30th of December to get back.",1,1,"Good day RandyThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

The problem started when they debited me for the full amount after they have paid me out and they removed my mother.
I called in today and spoke with Precious who made me hold for 30 minutes and hung up then I spoke with Shuaib who helped me a lot, asked to speak with a manager Shane, he was arrogant and very condescending, I asked for his surname and he didn't want to give nor wanted to transfer me to his manager Saseegah who also didn't want to give his surname.

And that's not all, if you are a loan shark and need to make someone's life difficult who is not paying you back, simply get their Capitec account blocked by providing them with the exact amount you paid over to their account and that's it, they will go and put the account under investigation...., very neat trick.

Unfortunately this customer of mine had already called the bank and reported me as a ""fraud"".

Capitec Bank blocked my account and demanded that I bring an Affidavit stating that I indeed payed back the money and I did that. When I went back a few days later to check why my account was still blocked they claimed they did not receive the Affidavit but I was there when they scanned and emailed it. Anyways, I still has it with me so I presented it. They told me it wasn't detailed enough I needed a new one, I went to the police station and came back, in the rain, and I presented the second affidavit. 

It has been weeks and my account is still ""under investigation"" I don't understand how or why, because even when my client called them to report me she was very clear why she was calling, and if the money was payed back to her why is my account still under scrutiny? Why am I still blocked??? What is it that needs to be investigated so much? It's been 3 weeks I'm pretty sure there's nothing to find if you still haven't found it.

I am not a criminal nor a fraud. Please open my account so I can withdraw the money that is in there and close my account with you.

2023/01/13 14:36,Willem N,My Bank treat me like a CRIMINAL!,"Wish there were an option where you can rate into a minus, cause all the faults add up!  

Around a month and a half ago i found some transactions on my account that were unaut****d. Small transactions like just under R100. On-line card purchases. 

I went to Capitec and request that this please get investigated as it is fraudulent transactions on my account. Capitec client care and the manager confirm this were fraud and will be investigated.  

They advice me to get a new card with new card number. I carry the cost (R70) of this as this is now clearly my mistake. I have this card for nearlyu 3 years, btw...  

With the new card I only use to order MRD online. the same transactions start to reappear. 

Brave I Went back to the bank today. 

Upset as another few transactions is off my account while i were sleeping... We sit there and sit there... forever, Irritrated!  

When i demand to speak with a manager, They cal the security on me! Massive alarms and wow. a commotion, as if i was now a massive risk!  They escort me out of the branch with a gun...  i was unarmed and only demand to speak with a manager. Demand what happen to my money... they refuse to speak with me... I get escorted, like a criminal, under weapons out of the bank and then out a shopping centre... take that? 

Pls can Capitec explain what i did wrong? 

Demand to know where my money so frequently disappearing to?  Or are you in on the deal?  How many people miss this amounts and don't even look at their statements? And while we talk at so many people in the so called ""FRAUD"" department, No one did nothing for me, not even a case nr, transfer from here to there and then back. terrible.  

Is it fair to pay bank cost to Capitec for allowing fraudulent deductions off your account, I counted over 30 of them, capitec must put a block on these deductions until a account user approved these on a cell phone or OTP?     Now you move your money to another account, then you gets charged R3 per bounced transaction... and capitec don't care. they see the charges and do nothing? Why? 

It was reported in the branch as YOU requested???  Why was their no action taken on this matter from management or from the ""FRAUD"" Department?   

The branch manager advice me to complain at the Ombudsman? Why?  She say H/O can not sort anything out...  Now I have to go fight for my money! We trust capitec with our money? 

While Capitec take there money and they do nothing? I wonder if Mr Fourie is aware of whats happening, and daily? Or another CEO so out of touch with his business that you never find him in the office. Try to call. There is a few school leavers that answer emails at the CEO Complain line. But there is no one except for customer care. they cannot make decisions or report anything, have many experiences and calls with the same so called customer service. when someone call with regards to fraud on their accounts, they don't know what to do! 

Seriously is there no place at capitec where you as an account user report fraud OR FRAUDUENT TRANSACTIONS. this make me question my relationship decision with this bank as I strongly believe they allow this and get a rewarded or have relation with these deductions. How from a old card and then a new card... same transactions can appear again? And no one at capitec can answer this. Or there is never no one to answer this. There is no one to investigate in the so called ""Fraud"" Department? 

If you get escorted with guns out of the bank You use for longer than 5 years, demanding what happen to your money, Is capitec now selling apples? or is clients now CRIMINALS? I was insulted in front of other client in the bank as well as in the shopping centre. the restaurant at the same door as the bank had a great show on my account. so please be careful as it seems capitec becomes a banana republic bank. 

THE MANAGER EVENTUALLY SPEAK WITH ME WITH NO SOLUTION OR NO REP[ORT OR NOTHING  SAME ANSWER AS BEFORE   AND NOTHING GETS DONE AGAIN SOME MAIL WERE SEND TO A LADY BUSY SOMEWHERE  NO URGENCY FROM THIS BANK  ANOTHER TRANSCATION WENT OF AT 14:35 13 JAN 2023   GREAT WORK CAPITEC

YOU WILL BE REMOVE WITH FORCE AND GUNS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU MONEY IS GOING

2023/01/12 18:38,NOMSA,Terrible Service,"Went to try and open a Capitec account because my colleagues convinced me it was a good move to do so. I am a spousal permit holder with an endor*****t to work.The Capitec agent advised me after conferring with the branch manager, that they do not open accounts for my permit type? I requested to speak to the manager who insisted the same, saying i could only apply for an account if i was on a work permit. Point to note, an endor*****t to work on any permit is a 'work permit', something that had definitely alluded the Capitec team. I asked him that, if that was regulatory standard accross the board, and also if the Government allowed me to work then how would i be expected to receive my salary which the branch manager obviously could not respond to. I have been a Nedbank account holder for several years because they are well informed on the issue and yet the Capitec staff could obviously not be bothered. I could be just one client now but the numbers do matter and my experience means a lot more people and therefore possible business has been turned away by Capitec due to the overly simplistic failure to establish where facts end and foreigner exclusion begins.",1,1,"Good day Samantha MillsThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/12 09:23,Deon B,Mercantile Bank possibly the worst Business Banking experience EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"I used Mercantile Bank in one of my businesses to run debit orders for many years, so when it came to for me to open another business account I decided out of loyalty I would open a business account with Mercantile. It first took days of backward and forwards to get the account opened. I was the one following up all the time with the ""personal banker"" Malibongwe Dlamini. A few weeks after my new business venture started, my client in the UK cancelled because of the load shedding issues in South Africa. So I created a new company which meant that I needed to change my bank account name. I requested this to happen in September 2022 - we are now in Jan 2023 and it has still not been done. Mr Dlamini eventually contacted me in late Nov (after I received numerous confirmations from read receipts that he had read my several emails asking him for feedback) he promised to get it done within the next 24 hours. Still nothing. In December I sent another email, this time to be greeted by his out of office message and to escelate to a colleague, which I did, his colleague did not even respond to my query. I have resorted to sending a frustrating email to every Capitec email address for customer experience I can find, and guess what, not a single response for 48 hours from anyone. I will be closing my account and NEVER recommend Mercantil Business to another person.

2023/01/12 09:12,Zakhona M,THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! WOLRD CLASS... WELL DONE!,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to this bank, Capitec Bank. I am new to this bank and the service I have received so far is by far THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!, WOLRD CLASS... 

The Call center agents are superb, polite, well informed, well spoken, you're simply putting other banks to shame. One particular lady at call center that stands out is Tarryn-Lee Roberts-Client Care, very helpful, patient and polite. She really cares...

At branch visit one guy stands out (he deserves a Mr D lunch, 3 Fridays in a row), Simon Letswalo at Capitec Bank Pretoria North Noordepark Centre. This guy is so helpful that I've been at the branch 3 times and I would rather wait until he's done with someone else so he can assist me, not because of his good looks lol but I feel like it's ok to be emotional and frustrated in front of him, he has that calm sympathetic spirit, he would say ""it's ok, I understand, don't worry about this, we'll sort this out"", He shows ubuntu and these days it's rare to experience such, anywhere. 

So I just want to express my sincere gratitude to you guys and seriously taken by surprise on how you're so quick on feedback, how great and polite the call center people are, the great people you're hiring in your firm. Truly a job well done...

I am a ""private client"" to the other bank but truly the service is nothing compared to this. This side, I do feel important and every case matters.

KEEP IT UP!!!

I went to Capitec but the assistant was so reluctant to help, 
The Capitec assistant phoned someone and that person said its nothing they can do to assist.
I asked for this money to be reversed and I was told by the assistant that they cannot reverse it.  They are reluctant to even phone the recipient to confirm if the money was pending or on hold.
This type of attitude from Capitec staff is unacceptable.

withdrawal limit I then lowered the amount to a thousand and the machine still gave the same message and it told me to take out my card, a receipt and my card came out and I walked towards the main branch to get inside the bank for some assistance. While I walked I received a notification that an amount of R1000 has been withdrawn I immediately brought this information to the customer service agents at the branch they looked at the machine and put up a note that the machine is out of service. I was told that an investigation will be made, I went on and pulled up a statement while doing so I overheard the agents whispering in the Afrikaans language that a similar incident had happened the day before. My issue is that all these agents can testify that I had not received my money yet a notification that the money had left the account was there. I was informed that the investigation will take 24hrs however within 2 hours I received a message that the investigation had been declined.

2023/01/10 11:43,Kim G,No protection  from Capitec for their clients,"So we canceled Rain WiFi in December however in January they have tried 8 times to take off a payment so I contacted the call center and spoke to Boingoelo and she tells me that they can't assist me with that I have to go into the bank and get a new card.  That is just ridiculous so I ask to speak to her manager who is Kholi who insisted that was the only way as well.  So I ask to speak to her manager Michelle Snub as none of this makes sense.  Conveniently she is in a meeting.  So here is my issue. Every other bank will look after their clients interest and put a stop payment on the account if a supplier is trying to take off a payment when not authorized to do so.  Yet Capitec is not willing to protect their clients in the same way.  We have Disney Plus, Netflix and DSTV coming off our account however we only take one of these every three months due to it being the same old same old.  We never have a problem with our cancelations with them or re starting up with them and they work on the same basis as Rain. So why are they now wanting me to make a new card that will cost me money firstly because they don't want to block a payment from my account.  No other bank makes their clients do that.

2023/01/10 08:26,Claudette M,Bad service,"My mother withdrew r2000 from a Capitec ATM in Witbank, the money didn't come out but was deducted from the account. She enquired inside and they told her they'll investigate, that  went on for about 3 weeks. Investigation came back clear no wrong findings of the ATM and she will not get her money back. They gave her some number to phone and see if she can retrieve the money herself. To say that I am disappointed is the least, how does that even happen in today's time. Why didn't they check camera to see if the money came out. There are always complaints about Capitec but this was the last straw my mom is definitely changing banks.",1,1,"Good day ClaudetteThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

2023/01/10 06:47,SP H,FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION - BETWAY,"<div>Last 2022, i went to Capitec Bank ( Nkomo Village) to lodge complain or query about fraudulent  transaction from Betway and requested the Bank to  close the transaction and investigate the matter. Capitec indicate that it is an online Transactions and there is nothing they can do about that, however they will investigate. on the 8th of 1 January 2023 around pass 4 to 5. R1500 and R2500 was taken from credit account to Savings and from savings to Betway account. on the 9th, i went to the same branch and queried about the similar query i complained about and indicated that i have no knowledge of this betway trasnaction. On the bank statement, the t amounts were reflecting as yet to be processed and asked the bank that they should freeze the transactions pending finalisation. Preliminary investigation was done and Betway was called and confirmed that i don't i have an account with them. what worries me is that the matter was reported before and nothing was done. i referred them to the previous case i reported and they could not  retrieve it from their audit trail. Betway indicated that we should provide them with proof of payment , SAPS case number and other supporting documents as requested so that they can investigate the matter on their side. what makes the matter worse is that R4000.00 is gone from their reputable client and capitec says that there is nothing they can do. The whole Fraud Investigation Department !!. I opened the case with SAPS and provided the Branch Manager Charmaine with the Case number yesterday late. I beg Capitec to freeze the transaction as it was still pending and will be easier to recover the many before the transaction is finalised and landing in the hands of the fraudster. But they refused vehemently, which is totally unfair for me.  i have now moved to Standard Bank as i am not sure if my money is safe with Capitec.</div>",1,1,"Good day SpThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

There were transactions happening on my account and left my account on a minus, i ended up canceling my card because I was suspecting fraud when I went to the branch they told me about the system problem and when I ask for a new card they told me that they will charge me R70 of which is unfair because it wasn't my fault.

2023/01/09 18:22,Anthony G,No Security at all at Capitec Bank,"Before I complain you need to her he full story.

On 5/1/23 I placed an order online with KFC. At check out I chose my card as I always do and it kept jumping back to check out, so I tried again, a view time and kept jumping back as if I must still order. Eventually  started getting error messages to try again later. Then I when to my banking and saw that the to my order went off 4 time and all the error charges without me even approving any transactions.

The very next day I phoned Capitec Bank's call center. I explained the situation to the call center agent and all she said to me was. I am so sorry this happened to you, but unfortunately there is not much she can do for me, once I put my banking details in some of the websites, they can take your money. I said to her, but what about the approval message from the bank as I always first need to log into my app and approve the transaction or put in the security details at the back of my card. she said to me 'NOT ALWAYS"". then said I need to get a letter from KFC Online for them to cancel the transactions as the did not go through yet. 

So basically she said to me, that Capitec Bank Offers no proper security for their customers at all.

About R1000 gone and I must now hope within 7 to 14 days I get my mony back from KFC.",1,1,"Good day Anthony Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

On 21-12-2022 I received an answer but loads of utterly useless information as well as rules and regulations for TFSA which I had informed them that I was fully aware of them.

2023/01/09 08:43,Nompumelelo Z,Gross Incompetence!!!,"I used my Capitec account for payments to a car hire company. I had taken an option that would have me keep the hired car til Jan 2023. My vehicle finance was approved on 3 Nov 2022, so I had to take the hired car back and go pick up my car. On 3 Nov, which was a Thursday, I made a card payment at the car hire branch with my Capitec card and they closed the account. The next Monday, 7 Nov, a debit order runs on my Capitec account for the monthly fee for the car hire. On 10 Nov, I get hold of a Mbali when I called customer service. She tells me to get the car hire to send a cancellation authorisation letter, which they send on the same day to Card Disputes at Capitec and not to Mbali. I follow up with Mbali on the 11th and send her a copy of the auth letter. She says she cannot see it as it is in the wrong format. I go back to the car hire and have them send it again, only to find that it had been in the correct format from the start. 

I then print the document and take it to the branch the next week after another follow up with Mbali, to find that she closed the request because she did not get the letter in the correct format. The consultant logs a ticket with Helpdesk, for them to reverse the one amount. He assures me this is a two hour process, it should be done by the end of the day. I only hear from Capitec the next day. After what was done, now all the funds that are deposited to the account, I have no access to. There is now a hold only my funds. They eventually release the hold and my funds are a available to me but the reversal of the one amount is still not done. I am then told that both the amounts have been processed. Capitec will have to escalate the matter now. 

On 18 Nov, yet another ticket is logged. This is now to get one of the two processed amounts reversed. Then I get a call from a guy that tells me they cannot reverse a processed amount. But I know this already, this why the ticket was logged to you!?
He says a call would need to be logged with MasterCard to reverse the money. This can only be done 30 days from the date of the transaction. I told him my frustration with this entire process and asked what was next. I specifically asked if I had to do something after the 30 days or he would, he said he would log the call after the 30 days.

Day 30 fell on 10 Dec because the payment I made at the car hire branch on 3 Nov was only processed on 10 Nov, which is why the debit on 7 Nov went through.

I use the WhatsApp option from Capitec to do a follow up around 14 Dec. The agent tells me nothing has been done, a note on the ticket says the 30 day period ends on 2 Jan 2023. I tell them even if it was 30 days from the day of the call, instead of the day of the transaction, 2 Jan is out of the question. They then tell me to go to a branch. I tell them I can't go driving through Soweto floods only to be told to wait for somebody on the other end to do something, like the 2 previous tickets that were logged at the branch. I let a few hours pass and use the same service again. The send agent tells me the same thing, the ticket is open and will be processed on 2 Jan after the 30 day period. I asked who put that note, age t said they don't have access to that info. I asked who the assigned person who is responsible for the ticket, they have no access to that information. I asked what would happen on 2 Jan, they both told me an sms with the following steps would be sent to me. No sms to date. I'm livid but I wait it out. 

Last week, on 4 Jan, I go to the branch. When the lady opens the ticket, it is closed. CLOSED!!! The resolution says ""Refer to notes"". The only note says something like, I spoke to client, she said she would log the call in to days. ***!!! After I specifically asked if it would be him or me and he said he would. She calls Helpdesk, yet again. After rehashing the entire story, the guy logs another ticket and says it will take another 30 days. Am I being pranked? After that conversation, the consultant tels me to wait for an sms acknowledging the ticket is being actioned. No sms still. I went to the branch yesterday and the consultant tels me there is no action on the ticket since it was logged. I am dumbfounded at the level of incompetence across  Capitec's platforms.

This basically is not the first time I encountered such a problem with your bank which is why I've always avoided doing any online transactions using your card.

I called your client service, I was told I must get authorization to reverse a transaction and I find that to be an inconvenience to me because this doesn't exist on the merchant's point. I spoke to Siya Ngubane reference **********73. The solution provided by this guy who is supposedly a manager does not make sense to me and I feel you guys didn't even attempt to put yourself in my shoes.

It doesn't make sense that I must send a request for an authorization from the people that don't have a transaction on record on their side. It is very stupid to refer a client to a merchant who does not have a record of a transaction on file. This basically tells me how badly you always inconvenience clients that really cannot even get a hold of merchant. In essence you are helping the inconvenience without considering your clients. It's very appalling, yes it might be your procedure but it truly doesn't make sense. I need this money to be reversed back into my account because the merchant doesn't have this transaction, yes I have called them and they are not prepared to send any documentation.

2023/01/05 12:23,caroline,DISGRACE,"Capitec bank is a disgrace! 

On the morning of 28th of December at 08:38  I contacted the call center to ask why I do not have credit insurance  on my Access account , to which he stated that I must have , and that I should simply visit a nearby branch to activate the credit insurance . On this same call he gave me confirmation that the credit insurance is already activated for my Credit card. 

(I did state to all parties that I spoke to that it could have been mentioned in the conversation that I could not have credit insurance when the application was done telephonically , but it was so much info given at once that I do not recall it all, so I want to rectify it )

Just after 9 I visited the branch in Margate. Here I explained my problem to the bank official. She ALSO then stated that I have to have credit insurance and that she will activate it for me. Then she discovered that she could not activate it and she contacted head office for more details as to why she could not activate it. After a while and talking to head office, the lady informed her that I could not have life cover because I am self-employed. According to her, Mr Wishwell Ntshaqa (The team leader) stated this.  (When I spoke to the lady as well , she then also informed me after I asked her , that there is NOT credit insurance on my Credit card as well (which is the opposite of what the call center has told me that same morning) )

After all of this, I was not happy at all. I then wanted to know why I was lied to about the credit insurance on my credit card and also wanted someone with authority to look into the case for credit insurance for my Access account , as well as my Credit card (For death cover only) . I then spoke directly to the lady from head office on the phone at the branch and she then informed me that one of 3 people will phone me on the 30th of December at 10:00. (She had sent emails to all 3 of them about this situation and one would then phone me) 

(Wishwell Ntshaqa – Team leader – Direct Loans)
(Sadiah – MIE Dept )
(Saeedah – MIE Dept) 

It is a week later already and STILL NO CALL from any one of the THREE people! 
What is the meaning of team leaders then if none of them are doing their job? It is no wonder that Mr Wishwell just simply said they cannot help me, because they are just too lazy to do their jobs by going to higher authority to solve the problems and attending to customer requests!

First I was lied to by the call center about the insurance on my credit card, and now Capitec has higher authority people “supposed to be tam leaders” who do not do their jobs or attend to their emails.  What a disgrace!!!!! 

Is there no management at Capitec? Only team leaders who try to avoid doing their jobs.",1,1,"Good day CarolineThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I was accosted by scammers and ended up losing the card. This happened around 15:15hrs. At 15:23hrs the scammers drew money at Engen Garage still in Dagbreek to the tune of R5000. They then made an EFT payment to Ikh“ Lovers N Friends E Rustenburg worth R3689.99. We reported the matter to the Capitec Branch in Elizabeth Street. We cancelled my the card. We opened a case at Welkom Police Station -  CAS 486/11/2022. The detective W/O DL Saayman gave us a letter to forward to Capitec Bank. We forwarded the letter to Jenielle La Meyer on the 5th December 2022. Capitec's response to us on 20th December was that we did not report the loss of the card. We had footages from Dagbreek Spar and Engen Garage of the incident. We provided these to  detective Saayman. On the 29th December 2022 we received the message that the case was closed.

2023/01/04 20:06,jonathan,simplified banking ? Surely they jest,I discussed my issue with a friend who also have a loan with capitec and was told someone called her to discuss a debit order to take place on the 15th instead of the 25th Dec as most definitely stipulated in the loan agreement. I was not called and just sent sms's. There was no money in my account because I switched banks and my salary was thus moved. As stated in a previous hellopeter report I walked into a capitec bank asking for a credit card and a consultant felt the need to switch debit order mandates which I did not ask for .Today I phoned in and spoke to a consultant named EMMA. Firstly I can't believe this bank is so cheap that it's not a shared call and she had no clue what I was talking about when I asked if it's a shared call. I asked her who was going to cover the bank costs for  attempted debit orders before arranged date and she had no answers. If the consultant back then did not move debit orders between banks I would not have had this issue. Nevertheless as stated on your recordings the calls are recorded for quality purposes. I told EMMA I can't afford to stay on the line to listen to her read a composition before debiting the loan amount. I told her the money was available and she should go ahead and debit and before I hung up I told her to call be back (to listen to her read her little composition). She promptly said yes and up to this moment I'm waiting for her call back. Why state in your sms people should call for assistance if you too incompetent to assist by simply calling back? Rest assured I will take this further with the banking ombudsman if the debit order does not go off AFTER the call I made today.,1,1,"Good day JonathanThank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.

I had to go to the branch on 3 occasions because they were offline and dealt with 3 different people.

I was also advised by the consultant when I went to the branch that I must take out loans and pay them off to boost my credit score ,little did I know that if you take out payday loans it drops the credit score drastically.

I eventually called them today to consolidate my loans so my credit score can repair but apparently I don't qualify.

I will be changing my bank and will advise people to stay away from a misleading bank.

2023/01/04 14:00,Lerato ,Horrible service received from capitec client services and forex department,"Good Day, 

I must I am disappointed by the horrible service I have been receiving from your client service and Forex department. I made an eft payment(normal) from my capitec account into an fnb Lesotho account of R1000.00 yesterday morning. This morning I checked with my helper if she received it and said she hasn’t.  I phoned your client service department, who then said I should phone Forex department as they are responsible for this type of query.

 I phoned forex said they are not responsible for reversing such transactions, I should contact client service because the payment was supposed to automatically reverse, I was put through back to client services, I was told it forex who is supposed to reverse it but if they don’t want to, client services will have to lodge a query which will take 14 days and I will be charged a fee and there is no guarantee if this money will be reversed or no.

Firstly I was not aware that capitec does not do international eft, secondly I cannot be held responsible for a fee for payment that was processed and allowed to go through by capitec systems when capitec does not do such payment. Third being given the run around by your two departments to sort this out and blame shifting between departments. This how clients should be treated, this is poor communication and disgusting client service from your end. No query has been registered because no one was willing to register it. I want my money returned because I have been inconvenienced greatly because my helper was supposed to be returning tomorrow and now she cannot because she has not received the money I sent her.

2023/01/03 09:21,Tinyiko M,"Capitec is not a bank, leave now!","Scammers managed to hack my bank account using my cell phone number, these scammers reversed my debit orders and sent themselves the money. These Scammers reversed amounts more than R300 which is the max reversal allowed on the app. Capitec insists that they can't help me because my pin was tampered with. I don't understand how their system allowed a reversal amount above the maximum allowed by the system. This is honestly so disappointing, this is not a bank it's a Stokvel.

2023/01/02 19:07,Thomas,Account blocked without communication,"I logged to my Capitec app this morning and find that my Savings Account was missing from a list of my account. Since they are always experiencing issues, I thought maybe it is one of those problems. Only to call them later and find out that my account was blocked due to suspected fraud. I didn't receive any notification from Capitec about this. Only found out when I was about to withdraw money. When I called their Contact Centre, I was told that someone deposit R555 into my account and reported that I committed fraud. My account has way more than that.

This is a very new account and I only use it for my day to day transactions. An agent by the name Ipfi was so arrogant and told me straight that the account won't be opened. Even if I go to the branch, my account won't be opened.

Now I am stuck at a Restaurant with an unpaid bill because Capitec decided to close my account without communication. If someone deposited R555 into my account and want it back for any reason whatsoever, why will I withhold it? This is terrible service.

Please reopen my account and let me transfer funds out of this terrible bank. I regret giving this bank a second chance.",1,1,"Good day Thomas Thank you for letting us know of your concern, and for your patience while we explore this matter.
