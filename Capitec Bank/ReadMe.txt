I was always amazed by how Capitec Bank deals with its clients. Providing longer operating hours from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm from Monday to Saturday makes it easy for their clients to get help at the branch even after work or on weekends. I was also fascinated by the fact that its clients are loyal to the bank; they would rather wait in a long queue to withdraw money than go to the nearest ATM. This made me question whether they were good with their client service or not, and how many people who use the bank have issues with the bank and what are the common issues the clients face. This made me go to the website HelloPeter to search for the answers to my questions.

I used an API to pull the data from the website. I used Python for data collection, and I used Excel and Python for data cleaning. I used Power BI for calculations, analysis, and visualization.

1. Open the "cleaningAPI" program to pull data from HelloPeter and write to a CSV file called "Capitec_Bank_Dataset".
2. Open the "Capitec Data Cleaning" program to clean the dataset and save the CSV as "clean_data".
3. Open the "clean_data" CSV and make the necessary data manipulations, such as deleting the extra records (we only require records for the year 2023). Convert the CSV file to an Excel sheet and save it as "Capitec_Bank_Final_Dataset".
4. Analyze and visualize on Power BI using "Capitec_Bank_Final_Dataset".
5. Publish the report."
